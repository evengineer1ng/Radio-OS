# Engine Audio Assets

Real onboard audio from different motorsport eras/tiers.

## Grassroots (Karting, Club Racing)

**Audio Character:**
- Raw, noisy, inconsistent RPM
- Slight clipping / mic distortion is a FEATURE
- 2-stroke bark or small 4-cylinder rasp
- Mechanical clatter, gear whine

**Files:** Place multiple variants as `grassroots_01.ogg`, `grassroots_02.ogg`, etc.

## Mid-Formula (Formula 4, Formula Regional, F3)

**Audio Character:**
- Cleaner, higher RPM band (10,000-12,000 RPM)
- Smoother throttle arcs
- More refined exhaust note
- Still has mechanical character

**Files:** Place as `midformula_01.ogg`, `midformula_02.ogg`, etc.

## Formula Z (Top Tier - F1, IndyCar-adjacent)

**Audio Character:**
- Hyper-clean, aggressive
- Almost inhumanly stable
- Extreme RPM range (15,000+ RPM for NA, turbos lower but intense)
- Downshift blips are surgical

**Files:** Place as `formulaz_01.ogg`, `formulaz_02.ogg`, etc.

## Technical Requirements

- **Format**: OGG Vorbis
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1 kHz
- **Duration**: 30-60 seconds minimum
- **Loop**: Should loop cleanly (steady-state throttle segment)
- **Volume**: Normalized to -3dB peak

## Important Design Rule

**Engine audio reflects WHERE you are, not HOW you're doing.**

Success/failure emotion comes from music and narrator, NOT engine sound.
