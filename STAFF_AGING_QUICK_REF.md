- **Principals:** Too young, need more experience

### Mid Career (30-40)
- **Drivers:** Peak or declining, expensive, short remaining career
- **Mechanics:** Peak performance, good value
- **Engineers:** Entering peak, excellent value
- **Strategists:** Prime years, very valuable
- **Principals:** Just entering prime, ideal hire

### Late Career (45+)
- **Drivers:** Retired or about to retire
- **Mechanics:** Post-peak, declining
- **Engineers:** End of peak, still capable
- **Strategists:** Still in peak, excellent
- **Principals:** Peak performance years
