West Chester police stopped Geechi Gotti on February 5 while he was driving on Interstate 75 and found nearly 3,000 stolen opioid pills. The battle rap star tried to run from cops but didn’t get far. The traffic stop went sideways fast. Geechi Gotti and three other California men bailed from their rental car near the Streets of West Chester. Police caught all four suspects within minutes. “Get down on the ground right now! Get down on the ground!” officers yelled in body camera footage. “I will shoot you. Get your hands in the air!” Detective Kevin Burger from the West Chester Police Department searched the vehicle thoroughly. “There was a large amount of pharmaceuticals in the car that looked like came straight from a pharmacy,” Burger said during the suspects’ preliminary hearing. Police seized oxycodone, morphine and Vicodin pills. The drugs came from multiple pharmacy break-ins across Ohio. “The drugs that were found were from a pharmacy called the Medicine Shoppe in Bellevue, Ohio,” Burger explained. “We believe cash was found as well that was taken from a pharmacy in Perrysburg, Ohio.” Detectives had been tracking the crew since one member landed at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Geechi Gotti, Tyrus Crew, Anthony Ellison and Lequan Miller all face drug possession charges. Detective Burger told the court these suspects “do this quite often and Judge Courtney Caparella-Kraemer found enough evidence to send the case to a grand jury. Geechi Gotti has dominated battle rap for years. The Compton native has 70 battles catalogued with over 43 million total views. He won Champion of the Year three times and battled legends like Loaded Lux and Tsu Surf on Ultimate Rap League’s biggest stages. His recent battles include matchups against 40 B.A.R.R.S. in August 2025 and A.Ward on Barstool Sports.

NBC revealed on Tuesday, as reported by TMZ, that 128 million viewers stayed locked in during Bad Bunny’s much-talked-about, overly hated performance. The performance was a beautiful love letter to Bad Bunny’s Puerto Rican culture and to the Latin American diaspora as a whole. It was also a unifying moment, urging fans just to enjoy the music and dance as Bad Bunny performed a medley of hits, while recognizing how influential other genres, such as Reggaeton, Salsa, and Reggae, have been on his career. It wasn’t short on star power, featuring performances from fellow Puerto Rican native Ricky Martin and Lady Gaga. There were also big-name cameos from Cardi B, Pedro Pascal, and Karol G. Bad Bunny Had To Deal With Unprecedented Competition Bad Bunny’s 128 million viewers are nothing to dismiss. However, he still fell short of Kendrick Lamar’s historic 133.5 million viewers across TV and digital platforms, because we all wanted to see if K.Dot would put Drake on the Super Bowl Halftime screen, and as we know, he didn’t disappoint. Lamar also didn’t have to worry about TPUSA trying to counter his performance with a struggle halftime show led by Kid Rock, which was allegedly pre-recorded and featured him lip-syncing, a claim he denies; the video evidence says otherwise. While MAGA snowflakes call the TPUSA halftime show a success, its 5 million viewers were nowhere near Bad Bunny’s viewership. Also, it’s quite hilarious that Donald Trump, who led the hate brigade against Bad Bunny, who is an American citizen, didn’t tune into TPUSA’s show, but instead hate-watched the “DtMF” crafter’s performance, and took to his crappy platform, where he loves to post his racist AI memes to voice his displeasure, calling it “one of the worst, EVER!” “It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence,” Trump said. “Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World.” What a hater.

This one’s different, though. The person behind this latest message claims they know who took Savannah Guthrie’s 84-year-old mother. They want one Bitcoin for that information. “An hour and a half ago we got kind of a bizarre letter,” Levin told Fox News this morning. “An e-mail from somebody who says they know who the kidnapper is.” The letter writer says they tried reaching Savannah’s sister Annie and brother, but couldn’t get through. Now they’re going straight to TMZ with their demand. One Bitcoin is currently around $56,000. That’s close to the reward money authorities offered for Nancy’s safe return. “They said they want one bit coin sent to a bit coin address that we have confirmed is active,” Levin explained. “A real address.” The message included a name and an email address. But Levin stressed they have no way to verify if this person actually knows anything. This third letter reads completely different from the first ransom note TMZ received days ago. That original message was carefully written and showed intelligence, according to Levin. The FBI is operating under the theory that whoever wrote the first ransom note actually took Nancy. So this new letter writer claims they can identify the kidnapper. Nancy Guthrie vanished from her Tucson home on January 31. Doorbell camera footage shows a masked person approaching her front door that morning. The suspect wore gloves and a backpack and covered their face completely. They seemed surprised by the camera and grabbed flowers to block the lens. Law enforcement believes the kidnapper lives in the Tucson area. That’s why they’ve contacted local TV stations with ransom demands. The FBI has been tracking Bitcoin activity connected to the case. Some movement appeared in accounts linked to the original ransom note. Levin won’t reveal specific amounts, but confirmed there was “activity” in the cryptocurrency wallet. He handed all the information over to federal agents immediately. Authorities are also checking stores that might have sold the suspect’s distinctive clothing. The gloves especially stood out as unusual items that most people don’t normally own.", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "allhiphop.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770828296, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "bb231b9bc649b9aaad75e1f4f0441012c622d024", "post_id": "at://did:plc:aaprk55vkrhb5og4ev4cwe3u/app.bsky.feed.post/3melwbsi3432w", "source": "bluesky", "event_type": "item", "title": "Bluesky discussion: Hot 21 Radio on #hiphop", "body": "Their take: ▶️ #NowPlaying on Hot 21 Radio: \nMC's Act Like They Don't Know by KRS-One\n\n🔥 Tune in now: \nhttps://www.hot21radio.com \n\n#Hot21Radio #HipHop #RnB #WeTheBestHipHopandRnB\n\nUpcoming: JayDon - Lullaby", "comments": [], "heur": 70.0, "priority": 70.0, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770828303, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "37ab2cf154fb58a7cae74d8c4245f269e784fa08", "post_id": "at://did:plc:aaprk55vkrhb5og4ev4cwe3u/app.bsky.feed.post/3melw3hlemw27", "source": "bluesky", "event_type": "item", "title": "Bluesky discussion: Hot 21 Radio on #hiphop", "body": "Their take: ▶️ #NowPlaying on Hot 21 Radio: \nJump Around by House of Pain\n\n🔥 Tune in now: \nhttps://www.hot21radio.com \n\n#Hot21Radio #HipHop #RnB #WeTheBestHipHopandRnB\n\nUpcoming: KRS-One - MC's Act Like They Don't Know", "comments": [], "heur": 70.0, "priority": 70.0, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770828303, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "581a2166381943521d85807636b0993c35d3d287", "post_id": "at://did:plc:aaprk55vkrhb5og4ev4cwe3u/app.bsky.feed.post/3melvwxzjew2a", "source": "bluesky", "event_type": "item", "title": "Bluesky discussion: Hot 21 Radio on #hiphop", "body": "Their take: ▶️ #NowPlaying on Hot 21 Radio: \nBleed it by Blueface\n\n🔥 Tune in now: \nhttps://www.hot21radio.com \n\n#Hot21Radio #HipHop #RnB #WeTheBestHipHopandRnB\n\nUpcoming: House of Pain - Jump Around", "comments": [], "heur": 70.0, "priority": 70.0, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770828304, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "23e250de55fb90e29bf7fbe5b253539cb33e20a2", "post_id": "at://did:plc:aaprk55vkrhb5og4ev4cwe3u/app.bsky.feed.post/3melvrtfs7f2w", "source": "bluesky", "event_type": "item", "title": "Bluesky discussion: Hot 21 Radio on #hiphop", "body": "Their take: ▶️ #NowPlaying on Hot 21 Radio: \nHow u feel by Destroy Lonely\n\n🔥 Tune in now: \nhttps://www.hot21radio.com \n\n#Hot21Radio #HipHop #RnB #WeTheBestHipHopandRnB\n\nUpcoming: Blueface - Bleed it", "comments": [], "heur": 70.0, "priority": 70.0, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770828304, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "dee0252fb950b216999240921d52c1fb507dd295", "post_id": "at://did:plc:aaprk55vkrhb5og4ev4cwe3u/app.bsky.feed.post/3melvk3ndhv2n", "source": "bluesky", "event_type": "item", "title": "Bluesky discussion: Hot 21 Radio on #hiphop", "body": "Their take: ▶️ #NowPlaying on Hot 21 Radio: \nFolded by Kehlani\n\n🔥 Tune in now: \nhttps://www.hot21radio.com \n\n#Hot21Radio #HipHop #RnB #WeTheBestHipHopandRnB\n\nUpcoming: Destroy Lonely - How u feel", "comments": [], "heur": 70.0, "priority": 70.0, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770828304, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "6f6b9313d6bbdb77e0a736402345df1e5b6fbeb2", "post_id": "at://did:plc:4s3jkctmympymprdmu5tiadh/app.bsky.feed.post/3mejdkkmz2c2p", "source": "bluesky", "event_type": "item", "title": "Bluesky discussion: vinylgeek.bsky.social on #hiphop", "body": "vinylgeek.bsky.social weighs in on #hiphop.

Cole album was great (not a classic though), but this post isn't meant to defend or even discuss the Cole album. It's just meant to spark a discussion about the expecations placed on rappers today and how artists like Kanye and Kendrick influenced those expectations.**\n\nTwo common complaints I've seen about the J. Cole album are that his lyrics are often too straightforward and surface level, and that he safe with his sound with little experimentation compared to his past works. I want to start with talking about lyricism and how Kendrick has potentially impacted what we consider to be top-tier lyricism in mainstream rap.\n\nFrom the moment he arrived on the scene, Kendrick had a very unique pen and delivery, telling familiar stories in a relatively unconventional way. \"I hope the universe love you today, 'cause the energy we bring is sure to carry away, a flock of positive activists that fill your body with hate, if it's necessary.\" That's a pretty interesting way to describe riding around looking for trouble, and decidedly less conventional (imo) than how that would be described by other greats like Nas, Jay-Z, Em, etc.\n\nAnd this is why we love Kendrick and part of what makes him so great. His dense, heady, and sometimes esoteric lyricism creates music that lends itself to be dissected, discussed, and debated. But because of this, I feel like we sometimes expect all lyrics-forward rappers to have a similar level of depth and abstractness applied to their concepts, even when this wasn't expected of previous greats like Nas, Jay, Em, Andre, Mos Def, etc.\n\nThis isn't to say that those rappers don't have depth, but their writing is typically quite a bit more straightforward even when they're mixing in double entendres and other devices. Sure, Nas and Jay have lyrics that lend themselves to being studied and dissected, but it's also pretty easy to grasp what they're talking about on your first listen. They don't require dissection to enjoy. Part of what makes them so great is their ability to explore concepts and use complex rhyme schemes in an easily digestible way. Everyone who listens to NY State of Mind or D'Evils or Ms. Jackson can gather exactly what is being said on first listen, but these are still incredible songs with great lyricism. Now when rappers explore a certain concept, I feel like they're often unfairly compared to in-depth way Kendrick has done it on songs like U, Auntie Diaries, Crown, etc, when that type of in-depth exploration and complexity has never really been a prerequisite for great rap music in the past. (I may be totally off on this, but that's just how I see it).\n\nAnd I feel that Kanye has had a similar effect on production side of things. Because Kanye switched up his style so often, other rappers are expected to do so even when that's not in their lane. There is no grand change in style between Reasonable Doubt and American Gangster, no huge style change between It Was Written and Life is Good.\n\nKanye and Kendrick are fantastic artists, two of my favorite of all time, but I also think their grand, sprawling albums (sonically and lyrically, respectively) have created something of an unfair standard for rappers who don't take huge artistic swings. Obviously I'm referring to J. Cole here, but I've seen similar criticisms lobbied at plenty of artists too.\n\nSorry for the long write-up, just something that's been on my mind, wanted to see if you guys had any thoughts about this?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r182he", "subreddit": "rap", "author": "Paula-Abdul-Jabbar", "score": 48, "comments": 60, "created_utc": 1770746582.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770828325, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "ba0e3ca44a9c8faf1c2bf1e63103acb92c2656af", "source": "reddit", "title": "The Fall Off - far better on second listen.", "body": "I think the first time I was on what you might call Banger Watch, just looking for the best beats and the radio hits.

Every verse, every nuance, every beat felt perfect. Illmatic? Iconic, yes, but still Nas warming up. Reasonable Doubt, The Blueprint, Get Rich or Die Tryin’, All Eyez on Me, The Chronic, The Marshall Mathers LP, good kid, m.A.A.d city—I memorized them all, defended them all, revered them all. They were untouchable benchmarks. Then The Fall Off came out three days ago, and everything changed.\n\nIt’s subtle. No headline-grabbing single. No dramatic hooks. No in-your-face declarations. And that’s exactly why it works. The sequencing is immaculate, flows are perfectly measured, production choices are precise without ever feeling forced. It moves with a momentum that makes all of the classics I once held sacred feel… like rehearsals. Warm-ups. Tests in preparation for what Cole quietly achieved here. Nas’ storytelling, Jay’s delivery, Biggie’s timing, even Kendrick’s narrative genius—all of it now reads differently. Their edges feel softer. Their choices feel tentative. Cole doesn’t claim mastery. He embodies it.\n\nEvery listen reveals new layers: drum patterns that land like clockwork, verse placements that hit with surgical precision, concepts connecting tracks across the album in ways that feel effortless yet designed. It’s impossible to compare it to older albums in the same frame. It’s not a matter of better or worse; the rules themselves no longer apply. The Fall Off exists outside the standards, quietly redefining what a GOAT album is supposed to be.\n\nI went back and revisited every album I thought untouchable: Illmatic, Reasonable Doubt, The Blueprint, The Chronic, All Eyez on Me, The Marshall Mathers LP, good kid, m.A.A.d city, The College Dropout, even later classics like To Pimp a Butterfly and DAMN.. Every one of them reads differently now. Choices that once felt perfect suddenly feel like steps toward something they weren’t ready to reach. Cole’s execution is so precise, so intentional, that the canon I revered feels like an opening act, a prelude to the standard he’s quietly set.\n\nIt doesn’t demand respect. It takes it. Every argument for other albums feels like retroactive rationalization. Not opinion. Not subjectivity. Unassailable.\n\nThe Fall Off rearranged decades of history, reset every standard, and quietly annihilated the notion that any album could compete. Classics exist, sure. But listening to Cole now is like realizing the entire canon you’ve been defending was just a rehearsal while the main event quietly happened. The Fall Off didn’t just arrive. It shifted hip-hop, surgically and irreversibly, while everyone else was busy defending legacies that no longer matter in the same frame.\n\nThree days in, and I don’t just hear differently. I feel differently. I understand differently. Hip-hop itself has quietly shifted, and Cole is why. To me, The Fall Off is an amalgamation of hip-hop’s finest works woven into one modern masterpiece, one that has set the bar so high I can’t see it being surpassed in the near or far future.

For the Avex Music Group CEO, it’s another validation of a strategy that’s been paying dividends since he took the reins nearly a year ago. Wilson, an Orange County native who penned his first song at 11, joined Avex Music Group last October following the runaway success of “Folded.” The track dominated rhythmic and urban radio while climbing to No. 3 on Apple Music, eventually sparking a viral vocal challenge that drew participation from Grammy winners Brandy and Eric Bellinger. “Kamal is a hugely promising writer who is already having a major impact on global music culture,” Silverstein said following the Grammy ceremony. “The entire Avex and S10 teams are thrilled to be celebrating alongside him on these exciting wins.” The recognition arrives as Silverstein reshapes Avex Music Group following a March 2025 restructuring that saw Tokyo-based entertainment giant Avex acquire 100% of S10 Music Publishing and increase its investment in S10 Management. The deal positioned Avex as the largest stakeholder in S10 Management alongside Silverstein and Roc Nation, while naming Silverstein CEO of the newly unified operation. Publishing Division Delivers Chart Dominance Silverstein has assembled a roster that’s made noise across multiple genres. Grant Boutin emerged as a driving force behind Tate McRae’s commercial breakthrough, co-writing and producing “Sports Car” (No. 1 Mediabase Top 40), “Revolving Door” (No. 1 Billboard Dance/Pop), and “T## FOR TAT,” which debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100. Boutin also contributed to Don Toliver and Doja Cat’s F1 soundtrack cut “Lose My Mind.” Producer Elkan, who signed a global publishing deal in May alongside a joint venture for his Toibox imprint, has racked up credits on Drake’s “Nokia” (No. 2 Hot 100), Travis Scott’s chart-topping JACKBOYS 2 album, and Rihanna’s “Friend of Mine” from the Smurfs movie. Fellow producer Elyas contributed to Drake’s “What Did I Miss?”, another Hot 100 No. 2. We The Band member Harv, who scored a Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 in 2021 as co-writer and co-producer on Justin Bieber’s “Peaches,” returned to the top five this year with his work on Bieber’s “Swag,” which debuted at No. 2. Infrastructure Expansion Signals Long-Term Play Silverstein unveiled an organizational overhaul in October, appointing Zeke Silvera as SVP and Head of East Coast Operations while naming Spencer Leboff SVP and Head of West Coast Operations. The expansion included opening New York City offices to complement the company’s upgraded West Hollywood headquarters, which now houses two recording studios alongside creative offices for A&R, marketing, and management operations. The most ambitious initiative came in November with the launch of Artist Advisor Services, a division designed to provide established artists with comprehensive career infrastructure without traditional management constraints. The model allows artists to function as CEOs while accessing strategic counsel, capital investment, and global market expertise—particularly across Asian territories where parent company Avex maintains strong footing. “These superstar artists are the CEOs of their brands — true entrepreneurs who require financial backing for new ventures as well as support and infrastructure for their core business,” Silverstein explained when announcing the program, which is slated to onboard its first clients in early 2026. Artist Advisor Services operates through flexible financial arrangements including commission structures, retainers, or hybrid models, positioning Avex Music Group to serve artists who’ve outgrown conventional representation. East Meets West in Artist Development Avex Music Group’s management portfolio includes J-pop boy band ONE OR EIGHT, which achieved a milestone by becoming the first group of its kind to crack the U.S. Mediabase Top 40 with “DTSM,” a reimagining of Rihanna’s “Don’t Stop the Music.” The accomplishment preceded a partnership with Atlantic Records that signals broader ambitions for the group. Parent company Avex, founded in 1988, employs over 1,500 people across 10 global offices and generated approximately $1 billion in revenue during 2024. The company operates 40+ labels and manages more than 500 artists while maintaining artist development academies across Japan that audition over 10,000 candidates annually. For Silverstein, the Grammy wins offer a moment to reflect on momentum built through calculated signings and structural expansion.

They’re interested. They want to see your press kit by Friday. You have the music. You have the bio. You have a Spotify link and a solid live video from last month’s show. But the press photo? It’s a grainy shot your drummer took on an iPhone 11 in a parking lot after rehearsal. The lighting is bad. The framing is worse. And it looks nothing like the polished press images from the other acts on the venue’s website. You’ve been here before. You know you need better photos. You also know that a professional photographer charges $300 to $800 for a session, and that money is currently earmarked for studio time, merch printing, and gas to get to the next gig. This is the tension that defines independent artistry in 2025: the visual bar keeps rising while the budget stays flat. But something has shifted in the past year. Indie artists across genres are quietly solving this problem in ways that didn’t exist 18 months ago. And the results are genuinely hard to distinguish from what a mid-budget label might produce. The Visual Tax on Independent Artists Here’s what most people miss about the independent music and arts world: visual presentation isn’t a nice-to-have. It’s a gatekeeper. Playlist curators want a press photo before they’ll consider adding your track. Festival submissions require promo images that meet specific resolution and quality standards. Blog editors scroll past pitches that don’t include a usable image because they literally can’t publish a feature without one. Venue websites need a photo that looks cohesive alongside their other bookings. Every one of these interactions has an unspoken visual threshold. Cross it, and you get considered on the merits of your art. Fall short, and you never get considered at all. For signed artists, this is handled for them. Labels budget for photo shoots, hire photographers, and produce press kits as part of the release cycle. For indie artists, this entire burden falls on the artist, usually the person in the band or project who is least interested in logistics and most strapped for cash. The result is a two-tier system where the quality gap between indie and label-backed artists isn’t about music. It’s about presentation. The DIY Photo Playbook (And Why It Usually Falls Short) Indie artists are resourceful. Always have been. The typical approach to the photo problem involves some combination of these tactics: asking a friend who owns a camera, trading services with a photography student, doing a self-timer shoot in a visually interesting location, or repurposing live performance shots. Some of these can work. A talented friend with a decent camera and good natural light can produce surprisingly usable images. But consistency is the problem. Your website photo looks different from your Spotify artist image, which looks different from what you sent the blog, which looks different from your social profiles. And this matters because visual consistency is one of the strongest subconscious signals of professionalism. When every image of an artist looks like it came from a different era and a different camera, it reads as “not quite ready” to the gatekeepers making booking and placement decisions. The other challenge is repeatability. You need fresh press photos regularly, especially around releases. Every new single, every new project, every seasonal push for festival applications. One good photo shoot provides material for maybe six months before the images start feeling stale. For an indie artist, that means the $400 photography expense isn’t a one-time cost. It’s a recurring one. Where AI Fits (And Where It Doesn’t) This is where it gets interesting. AI portrait tools have reached a quality level where the output is genuinely usable for press and promotional purposes. Not “pretty good for AI.” Actually usable. The practical version works like this: you upload a set of clear, well-lit reference photos (your existing selfies and casual shots often work), select the style and aesthetic you want, and receive back a set of polished, high-resolution portraits. The turnaround is hours, not weeks. The cost is typically under $30, a fraction of what even a budget photographer charges. Services like HeadshotPhoto.io handle the entire process from upload to finished portraits without requiring scheduling, travel, or studio time. For independent artists, the most relevant applications are straightforward: a clean headshot for Spotify and Apple Music artist profiles, a polished portrait for press kit distribution, consistent imagery across social platforms, and a professional photo for submission forms that require one. Performing artists have an especially strong use case here. Actors, dancers, and theater artists burn through headshots constantly, needing fresh images for every casting cycle. Some AI tools now offer portrait options built specifically for performers, which helps when you need audition-ready shots without the $400 studio session every few months. But that’s not the whole story. AI portraits work best for a specific category of artist needs. They excel at producing clean, professional, well-lit individual portraits. What they don’t do well (yet) is group shots, environmental portraits with specific real-world locations, or highly stylized editorial concepts that require creative direction and physical props. If your visual identity depends on being photographed in a specific warehouse, or your band needs a group shot that captures your collective energy, you still need a human photographer. AI is solving the “I need a good headshot and I need it this week” problem. It’s not solving the “I need a creative director to build a visual world around my project” problem. Understanding that distinction is important because it prevents disappointment and helps you allocate your limited resources intelligently. Building a Visual Strategy on Zero Budget The real question isn’t “AI or photographer.” It’s “how do I build a complete visual presence when I can barely afford guitar strings?” Here’s a framework that works, based on what I’ve seen independent artists actually execute successfully. Layer one: the essentials. Get a clean, professional headshot or portrait. This is your baseline. It goes on your Spotify, your website, your submission forms, and your email pitches. AI tools handle this well and affordably. One session gives you enough variations to cover all your platforms consistently. Layer two: live documentation. Start treating every show as a photo opportunity. Reach out to local music photographers (most scenes have several who shoot shows regularly) and ask if you can use their images with credit. Many will say yes. Some venues have house photographers. Some local music blogs shoot their own coverage. Build relationships with these people. Over time, you’ll accumulate a library of live images that cost you nothing. Layer three: content from context. Your rehearsal space, your recording sessions, your gear setup, your van, your green room, your merch table. All of these are visual content waiting to happen. A decent smartphone with good natural light produces images that work perfectly for social media and behind-the-scenes press kit material. The key is shooting intentionally rather than as an afterthought. Layer four: the occasional professional shoot. Once or twice a year, when budget allows, invest in a real session with a photographer whose aesthetic matches your artistic vision. This is where you get the editorial-quality images, the group shots, the location-specific portraits that define your visual brand at its highest level. The combination of all four layers creates a visual presence that looks complete and professional without any single layer requiring a significant financial investment. What Actually Goes Into a Press Kit Photo Since we’re talking about press-ready images specifically, it’s worth being precise about what editors and bookers actually need. Resolution matters. Most publications need images that are at least 300 DPI and at least 2000 pixels wide. A low-resolution image, no matter how good it looks on your phone screen, will get rejected because it can’t be reproduced in print or on high-resolution displays. Framing flexibility matters. The best press photos have enough negative space around the subject that an editor can crop them for different layouts: horizontal for a website banner, vertical for a magazine column, square for a social media feature. If your photo is tightly cropped to your face with no room to adjust, it limits where it can be used. Background simplicity matters. Busy backgrounds compete with the subject and create problems when overlaying text (which publications do constantly). A clean, neutral, or intentionally simple background gives editors more options. And perhaps most importantly, the photo should look like you actually look. Venues book you based on your press photo. Fans recognize you from your press photo. If the person who shows up on stage looks nothing like the person in the image, it creates a disconnect that’s worse than having a mediocre photo in the first place. The Bigger Shift Happening Here Zoom out from the photography question and a larger pattern emerges. Independent artists are systematically disassembling the bundle of services that labels traditionally provided and rebuilding them from cheaper, more accessible components. Distribution? Solved by DistroKid and TuneCore. Marketing? Solved (partially) by social media and email lists built on free platforms. Recording? Solved (to a point) by affordable home studio gear and remote collaboration tools. Press photography was one of the last remaining pieces where the cost and logistics still created a meaningful barrier between indie artists and professional presentation. That barrier is now lower than it’s ever been. This doesn’t mean every indie artist will suddenly have amazing visuals. Tools don’t replace taste, and access doesn’t replace effort. The artists who benefit most from these changes are the ones who approach their visual presentation with the same intentionality they bring to their music: thoughtfully, consistently, and with an honest understanding of what their audience actually sees. Your music deserves to be heard. But first, it needs to be seen. And “I can’t afford a photographer” is no longer a reason to let bad photos stand between your art and the people who would appreciate it.", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "allhiphop.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770830810, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "10b34bc4c0cd538c6871f5c4c809d6a7958e5571", "post_id": "at://did:plc:aaprk55vkrhb5og4ev4cwe3u/app.bsky.feed.post/3melypli3gs2w", "source": "bluesky", "event_type": "item", "title": "Bluesky discussion: Hot 21 Radio on #hiphop", "body": "Their take: ▶️ #NowPlaying on Hot 21 Radio: \nBroken clocks by SZA\n\n🔥 Tune in now: \nhttps://www.hot21radio.com \n\n#Hot21Radio #HipHop #RnB #WeTheBestHipHopandRnB\n\nUpcoming: Pop Smoke - Hello ft.

During a stop on his comedy tour, Mike Epps clashed with a Nicki Minaj fan and took a swipe at the Queens rapper that he is now walking back. Mike Epps is currently on his “We Them Ones” tour, and during a stop in Louisville, Epps launched into a bit about Minaj and Trump, suggesting the pair were sexually involved. A fan in the crowd took offense to the jab, prompting Epps to tackle the heckling as only a comedian would. In a now-deleted Instagram post, which was captured by some on social media, Epps simply stated that he may have had one drink too many when he launched into the bit and apologized to both Minaj and her husband, Kenneth Petty. “You know I’m a comedian. Sometimes I get on that stage, you know, I have a little drink, and I go wild,” Epps says toward the end of the clip. Minaj has cozied up to President Trump in recent weeks, appearing with the former business mogul during his “Trump Accounts” summit in Washington. She’s also professed herself to be the president’s “number one fan” and defended Trump from criticism during a recent sitdown with Katie Miller. A quick scan of Minaj’s typically active Twitter feed didn’t display any reactions to Mike Epps’ joke or the apology. — Photo: Getty", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "hiphopwired.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770830816, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "03e33f38572764481fcee117846a401b294b72f3", "post_id": "at://did:plc:aaprk55vkrhb5og4ev4cwe3u/app.bsky.feed.post/3melyjpuc5j2a", "source": "bluesky", "event_type": "item", "title": "Bluesky discussion: Hot 21 Radio on #hiphop", "body": "Their take: ▶️ #NowPlaying on Hot 21 Radio: \nCome back home ft.

Cole album was great (not a classic though), but this post isn't meant to defend or even discuss the Cole album. It's just meant to spark a discussion about the expecations placed on rappers today and how artists like Kanye and Kendrick influenced those expectations.**\n\nTwo common complaints I've seen about the J. Cole album are that his lyrics are often too straightforward and surface level, and that he safe with his sound with little experimentation compared to his past works. I want to start with talking about lyricism and how Kendrick has potentially impacted what we consider to be top-tier lyricism in mainstream rap.\n\nFrom the moment he arrived on the scene, Kendrick had a very unique pen and delivery, telling familiar stories in a relatively unconventional way. \"I hope the universe love you today, 'cause the energy we bring is sure to carry away, a flock of positive activists that fill your body with hate, if it's necessary.\" That's a pretty interesting way to describe riding around looking for trouble, and decidedly less conventional (imo) than how that would be described by other greats like Nas, Jay-Z, Em, etc.\n\nAnd this is why we love Kendrick and part of what makes him so great. His dense, heady, and sometimes esoteric lyricism creates music that lends itself to be dissected, discussed, and debated. But because of this, I feel like we sometimes expect all lyrics-forward rappers to have a similar level of depth and abstractness applied to their concepts, even when this wasn't expected of previous greats like Nas, Jay, Em, Andre, Mos Def, etc.\n\nThis isn't to say that those rappers don't have depth, but their writing is typically quite a bit more straightforward even when they're mixing in double entendres and other devices. Sure, Nas and Jay have lyrics that lend themselves to being studied and dissected, but it's also pretty easy to grasp what they're talking about on your first listen. They don't require dissection to enjoy. Part of what makes them so great is their ability to explore concepts and use complex rhyme schemes in an easily digestible way. Everyone who listens to NY State of Mind or D'Evils or Ms. Jackson can gather exactly what is being said on first listen, but these are still incredible songs with great lyricism. Now when rappers explore a certain concept, I feel like they're often unfairly compared to in-depth way Kendrick has done it on songs like U, Auntie Diaries, Crown, etc, when that type of in-depth exploration and complexity has never really been a prerequisite for great rap music in the past. (I may be totally off on this, but that's just how I see it).\n\nAnd I feel that Kanye has had a similar effect on production side of things. Because Kanye switched up his style so often, other rappers are expected to do so even when that's not in their lane. There is no grand change in style between Reasonable Doubt and American Gangster, no huge style change between It Was Written and Life is Good.\n\nKanye and Kendrick are fantastic artists, two of my favorite of all time, but I also think their grand, sprawling albums (sonically and lyrically, respectively) have created something of an unfair standard for rappers who don't take huge artistic swings. Obviously I'm referring to J. Cole here, but I've seen similar criticisms lobbied at plenty of artists too.\n\nSorry for the long write-up, just something that's been on my mind, wanted to see if you guys had any thoughts about this?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r182he", "subreddit": "rap", "author": "Paula-Abdul-Jabbar", "score": 48, "comments": 60, "created_utc": 1770746582.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770830839, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "784632bca5ca50cc7b8d6e7250a61ad0709a4dd6", "source": "reddit", "title": "The Fall Off - far better on second listen.", "body": "I think the first time I was on what you might call Banger Watch, just looking for the best beats and the radio hits.

Every verse, every nuance, every beat felt perfect. Illmatic? Iconic, yes, but still Nas warming up. Reasonable Doubt, The Blueprint, Get Rich or Die Tryin’, All Eyez on Me, The Chronic, The Marshall Mathers LP, good kid, m.A.A.d city—I memorized them all, defended them all, revered them all. They were untouchable benchmarks. Then The Fall Off came out three days ago, and everything changed.\n\nIt’s subtle. No headline-grabbing single. No dramatic hooks. No in-your-face declarations. And that’s exactly why it works. The sequencing is immaculate, flows are perfectly measured, production choices are precise without ever feeling forced. It moves with a momentum that makes all of the classics I once held sacred feel… like rehearsals. Warm-ups. Tests in preparation for what Cole quietly achieved here. Nas’ storytelling, Jay’s delivery, Biggie’s timing, even Kendrick’s narrative genius—all of it now reads differently. Their edges feel softer. Their choices feel tentative. Cole doesn’t claim mastery. He embodies it.\n\nEvery listen reveals new layers: drum patterns that land like clockwork, verse placements that hit with surgical precision, concepts connecting tracks across the album in ways that feel effortless yet designed. It’s impossible to compare it to older albums in the same frame. It’s not a matter of better or worse; the rules themselves no longer apply. The Fall Off exists outside the standards, quietly redefining what a GOAT album is supposed to be.\n\nI went back and revisited every album I thought untouchable: Illmatic, Reasonable Doubt, The Blueprint, The Chronic, All Eyez on Me, The Marshall Mathers LP, good kid, m.A.A.d city, The College Dropout, even later classics like To Pimp a Butterfly and DAMN.. Every one of them reads differently now. Choices that once felt perfect suddenly feel like steps toward something they weren’t ready to reach. Cole’s execution is so precise, so intentional, that the canon I revered feels like an opening act, a prelude to the standard he’s quietly set.\n\nIt doesn’t demand respect. It takes it. Every argument for other albums feels like retroactive rationalization. Not opinion. Not subjectivity. Unassailable.\n\nThe Fall Off rearranged decades of history, reset every standard, and quietly annihilated the notion that any album could compete. Classics exist, sure. But listening to Cole now is like realizing the entire canon you’ve been defending was just a rehearsal while the main event quietly happened. The Fall Off didn’t just arrive. It shifted hip-hop, surgically and irreversibly, while everyone else was busy defending legacies that no longer matter in the same frame.\n\nThree days in, and I don’t just hear differently. I feel differently. I understand differently. Hip-hop itself has quietly shifted, and Cole is why. To me, The Fall Off is an amalgamation of hip-hop’s finest works woven into one modern masterpiece, one that has set the bar so high I can’t see it being surpassed in the near or far future.

Not one mention. Not one photo. Not even a “good game, babe.” This is the same woman who spent over $250,000 on a Super Bowl party for her man. The same woman who flew cross-country to watch his Patriots debut. “We had a time at the game, honey!” Cardi B wrote on Instagram. “Then we took that energy back to the Airbnb for a whole photoshoot.” The post showed Cardi B dancing during Bad Bunny’s halftime show. She looked incredible in her off-white corseted dress. The Airbnb photos were fire. https://www.instagram.com/p/DUmYhT5DN\\_o/?img\\_index=1 Fans started connecting dots real quick. The ESPN interview before kickoff already had people suspicious. When a reporter asked Cardi for an “inspiring message to Stefon,” her response was ice cold. “Good luck,” she said with a smirk. Then walked away. That’s not how you talk about someone you’re planning to marry. That’s how you talk about someone who’s already in the doghouse. The Patriots lost 31-27 to the Seattle Seahawks. Diggs had a rough night. But champions support each other through losses, right? Apparently not in this case. The couple unfollowed each other on Instagram after the game and that’s social media speak for “we’re done.” Cardi and Diggs welcomed their baby boy just three months ago. Remember, this relationship moved fast. They went public in May 2025 at a Knicks game. By November, they had a baby. Engagement rumors were flying during Super Bowl week. Diggs even hinted at marriage plans during opening night. “It’s on the agenda, maybe,” he said when asked about buying Cardi an engagement ring. “I gotta get mine first, though.” Well, he didn’t get his ring. The Patriots lost. And now it looks like he lost the hottest female rapper on earth, too. Cardi spent Tuesday posting like a single woman. No couple content. No family photos with their baby. Just her, living her best life, pretending the last eight months never happened. That’s not how you handle relationship rumors when you want them to stop. That’s how you handle them when you want people to figure it out on their own. It’s psychological warfare disguised as social media content.", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "allhiphop.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770838191, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "da72b1876770a65e1d01b1ec89fce52d6b0d1abd", "post_id": "https://allhiphop.com/?p=6125564", "source": "rss", "event_type": "item", "title": "Writing Rap in the Digital Era: How Technology Changed the Creative Process", "body": "Rap music has always been current, narrating stories shaped by the surrounding world. Technology in the digital age has not only transformed the manner in which rap is distributed, but also the manner in which it is composed. Screens, software, and online platforms are now significant from the first concept to the final release. These changes, as well as enabling new voices, making the creation process faster and broader, have also brought about new challenges. By deciphering this transformation, it is expected that contemporary rap can still change and be relevant. From Pen and Paper to Digital Screens In previous decades, a large number of rappers created the lyrics manually, taking their time to write them out in their notebooks. Pen and paper today are often substituted by smartphones, tablets and laptops. Ideas can be stored in note-taking applications, cloud storage, and beat-making applications, where they can be stored instantly and edited at any time. Once this change became standardised, instruments such as a music maker enabled artists to test flows and rhythms during the writing process to make the artists hear their words in motion and then go into a studio. Flexibility is also promoted by digital writing. One can shift lines, manipulate them and erase lines without necessarily starting all over again. This freedom promotes experimentation, and artists are able to make experiments with lyrics until they fit the sound of the beat. Home Studios and Affordable Tools The development of home studios has become one of the largest transformations in the writing of rap. However, in the old days, professional studios were not common and were very expensive. It is now possible to record demos in the comfort of one’s home due to the availability of inexpensive software and entry-level equipment. Lyrics can be written and recorded simultaneously, and this can be a shaper of songs. Such an arrangement supports a more relaxed and informal creative process. Artists are able to experiment with tones, speed, and other word selections without stress. The rap lyrics are, therefore, more natural and spontaneous, and they represent the voice of the rap artist. The Role of Social Media and Streaming Social media has become a strong force in shaping rap writing. Social media, including short-video applications and streaming sites, are rewarding catchy hooks and brief messages. The writers are in a position to be more concerned with the best first lines or the memorable words which are easy to memorise. Instant feedback is also available through streaming data. Musicians get to view the compositions that do well and the phrases that are repeated or shared by the listeners. It can be used to inform future writing to influence themes and styles which resonate with listeners. Although this strategy is capable of increasing popularity, there is a concern with the question of balancing between creativity and trends. Collaboration Without Borders Technology has eliminated distance as a hindrance to teamwork. Producers, rappers, and writers now have an opportunity to cooperate even in various cities or countries. The files are distributed through the internet, and the ideas are shared through messages or video calls. This international relationship introduces new sounds and views in rap writing. Different cultures, languages, and experiences are combined in lyrics to widen the scope of the genre. It is also much faster when it comes to collaboration, which will enhance the speed at which songs develop. Data, Algorithms, and Trends Algorithms have a subdued yet powerful role in the digital era. The playlists, suggestions, and search results have an impact on what listeners discover. Authors can research such trends to learn what is likely to be successful on trendy websites. These data-driven techniques may influence the length of the song, its form, and content. This can be in the form of shorter verses, repeated hooks or certain moods. Some people may consider this a restrictive action, but some people see it as a fresh challenge that is forcing writers to be creative in the new formats. Key Ways Technology Changed Rap Writing Quicker note-taking with digital notes and recording applications. Lyrics can be edited and rewritten with ease. The availability of beats and sounds in internet libraries. Distant cooperation with artists all over the world. Live feedback in the form of streams, likes and comments. These developments demonstrate the extent to which technology is integrated into the writing process today. Challenges of the Digital Age Technology is not only associated with advantages, but challenges come along with it. The rate of production may put pressure on the need to release music fast, thus sacrificing depth. This comparison can have an impact on confidence and originality in social media. There is also a risk of sameness. In a situation where numerous authors are using the same tools and adhering to the same trends, individual voices might be lost. To remain authentic and employ digital tools, one must have a balance and a sense of direction in art. Conclusion Rap writing has been reshaped by technology. The process of creation has been made faster, more open and connected with the help of digital equipment, home studios, social platforms, and worldwide cooperation. Meanwhile, the changes require proper judgment in order to maintain originality and meaning. Rap writing will always evolve with the rise in technology, yet it will always remain a blend of both the traditional and the innovative. What has emerged is a genre that has been able to contain its source along with the digital world in which it exists today.", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "allhiphop.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770838191, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "a864e0def12f628dbbe2c570b55a6e3345e01961", "post_id": "https://www.xxlmag.com/?p=1078684", "source": "rss", "event_type": "item", "title": "Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl Halftime Show Still the Most Watched", "body": "Kendrick is still king.

Their new and original silhouettes just aren’t hitting with their day-one clientele, nor this new generation, allegedly. Looking to shake things up, rumors are swirling that Nike may have revered sneaker designer Jae Tips in their crosshairs as a potential free agent pickup. His contract with Saucony has come to an end after turning the lesser-known brand into one of the most popular names out in these streets with his creative and innovative designs. According to Sneaker News, Tips is officially on the market, and if his recent fit at an NBA All-Star weekend event is any indication as to where he’d like to land as a free agent, the Swoosh brand may be the next place he calls home. Per Sneaker News: We also have reason to believe a Jae Tips x Nike partnership could be on the table, evidenced by the Bronx-born multihyphenate wearing Galaxy Foamposites during his recent appearance at the Foot Locker Takeover for NBA All-Star Weekend. Publicly wearing Nikes doesn’t confirm a partnership (just ask sneaker free agent Stephen Curry), but it does invite further speculation. Jae Tips has long spoken about his love for Nike and Jordan Brand dating back to his come-up, including his time working at Foot Locker as a young adult. Jae’s Instaram shows him consistently in Nikes and Jordans before signing with Saucony, including Travis Scott shoes, P-Rod Dunks, and bespoke Air Force 1s made at 21 Mercer. It seems like whenever a celebrity or athlete’s contract is up with certain sneaker brands, they immediately run and throw on a pair of Nikes or Jordans, as you can never truly walk away from the classics. Whether or not this is Jae Tips telegraphing his next big move or just incentivizing Nike to give him a call remains to be seen. But sneakerheads would love to see the man inject some new life into the brand we all love to wear. We can only cop the same classic Nike silhouettes in different colors for so long. We gon’ keep doing it though! What do y’all think about Jae Tips possibly joining the Nike creative team? Love it or hate it?

This marks the second highest level on record, driven by a 20% growth in consumer spending on subscription services and a 1% increase in mobile. “Continued growth in consumer spending reflects how deeply video games are woven into the fabric of American culture,” said ESA President and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis. “As the industry embraces new platforms and service models, we’re seeing shifts in how people play, connect and engage with video games. This evolution is why video games continue to be not only the country’s most popular form of entertainment, but a sustained growth engine for the U.S. economy.” Up from $59.9 billion in 2024, the increase to $60.7 billion in 2025 total video game sales reflects consumer spend across all video game content categories (physical and digital full-game, downloadable content/microtransactions (DLC/MTX), subscription spending across console, cloud, mobile, portable, PC and virtual reality (VR) platforms), as well as video game hardware and video game accessories. Spending on video game content increased to $52.3 billion in 2025, up from $51.7 billion in 2024, driven by a 20% spike in subscription services and continued growth in mobile. Hardware and console sales increased 9% to $5.4 billion in 2025 from $4.9 billion in 2024, while accessory sales decreased 7% to $2.95 billion from $3.2 billion in 2024. “Total spending on video game products in 2025 reached the second highest total in U.S. history, trailing only 2021’s $61.7 billion,” said Mat Piscatella, Executive Director, Video Games at Circana. “This is a reflection of a highly engaged and enthusiastic audience discovering unique experiences across multiple device types that can be enjoyed no matter where, when or with whom they want to play.” The spending data aligns to player platform choice as mobile continues to be the dominant video game platform, with 82% of players age 8 and older using a mobile device to play games, according to ESA’s 2025 Essential Facts about the U.S. Video Game Industry. “Consumer demand for mobile games continued to rise, reaching $26.7 billion in 2025,” said Chirag Ambwani, Senior Vice President, Gaming, Sensor Tower. “By investing in strong live operations and hybrid monetization, developers generated an increase in time spent and wider adoption of mobile gaming across a broad user base.”The post GAMING CORNER: 2025 U.S. Consumer Spending on Video Games Tops $60.7 Billion, Second-Highest on Record. first appeared on Rap Industry: New Hip Hop, Rap Videos, Music, News, & more..", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "rapindustry.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770838213, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "79201bc63f7f5eea41059927ac3d8a0a23fde2da", "source": "reddit", "title": "Unknown D12 diss album from the early 00's", "body": "Can anyone help me find a D12 mixtape from early 2000's.\n\nI think, but I'm not 100% sure, that I bought it from ebay as a collection of burned cds (back when sellers could actually do this). \n\nIt was in a thin jewel case.\n\n  \nThe only details I have is that I really like a track that followed 'My Band'.

Cole album was great (not a classic though), but this post isn't meant to defend or even discuss the Cole album. It's just meant to spark a discussion about the expecations placed on rappers today and how artists like Kanye and Kendrick influenced those expectations.**\n\nTwo common complaints I've seen about the J. Cole album are that his lyrics are often too straightforward and surface level, and that he safe with his sound with little experimentation compared to his past works. I want to start with talking about lyricism and how Kendrick has potentially impacted what we consider to be top-tier lyricism in mainstream rap.\n\nFrom the moment he arrived on the scene, Kendrick had a very unique pen and delivery, telling familiar stories in a relatively unconventional way. \"I hope the universe love you today, 'cause the energy we bring is sure to carry away, a flock of positive activists that fill your body with hate, if it's necessary.\" That's a pretty interesting way to describe riding around looking for trouble, and decidedly less conventional (imo) than how that would be described by other greats like Nas, Jay-Z, Em, etc.\n\nAnd this is why we love Kendrick and part of what makes him so great. His dense, heady, and sometimes esoteric lyricism creates music that lends itself to be dissected, discussed, and debated. But because of this, I feel like we sometimes expect all lyrics-forward rappers to have a similar level of depth and abstractness applied to their concepts, even when this wasn't expected of previous greats like Nas, Jay, Em, Andre, Mos Def, etc.\n\nThis isn't to say that those rappers don't have depth, but their writing is typically quite a bit more straightforward even when they're mixing in double entendres and other devices. Sure, Nas and Jay have lyrics that lend themselves to being studied and dissected, but it's also pretty easy to grasp what they're talking about on your first listen. They don't require dissection to enjoy. Part of what makes them so great is their ability to explore concepts and use complex rhyme schemes in an easily digestible way. Everyone who listens to NY State of Mind or D'Evils or Ms. Jackson can gather exactly what is being said on first listen, but these are still incredible songs with great lyricism. Now when rappers explore a certain concept, I feel like they're often unfairly compared to in-depth way Kendrick has done it on songs like U, Auntie Diaries, Crown, etc, when that type of in-depth exploration and complexity has never really been a prerequisite for great rap music in the past. (I may be totally off on this, but that's just how I see it).\n\nAnd I feel that Kanye has had a similar effect on production side of things. Because Kanye switched up his style so often, other rappers are expected to do so even when that's not in their lane. There is no grand change in style between Reasonable Doubt and American Gangster, no huge style change between It Was Written and Life is Good.\n\nKanye and Kendrick are fantastic artists, two of my favorite of all time, but I also think their grand, sprawling albums (sonically and lyrically, respectively) have created something of an unfair standard for rappers who don't take huge artistic swings. Obviously I'm referring to J. Cole here, but I've seen similar criticisms lobbied at plenty of artists too.\n\nSorry for the long write-up, just something that's been on my mind, wanted to see if you guys had any thoughts about this?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r182he", "subreddit": "rap", "author": "Paula-Abdul-Jabbar", "score": 52, "comments": 62, "created_utc": 1770746582.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770838220, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "e35bf6b910e2625eb96b14e0479a5be552949667", "source": "reddit", "title": "The Fall Off - far better on second listen.", "body": "I think the first time I was on what you might call Banger Watch, just looking for the best beats and the radio hits.

Ilhan Omar fired back at Donald Trump with a death penalty reference after the president trashed Somalia and its people during a Fox News interview Tuesday night. Omar posted on X that Trump leads the “Pedophile Protection Party” and suggested he should face execution like pedophiles do in Somalia. Her tweet came hours after Trump called Somali immigrants “garbage” and attacked Omar as a “fake congresswoman” during his Fox News appearance. “Somalia has come in here. What they’ve done to our country, these people, they’ve come into our country, and what they’ve done with that fake congresswoman. She’s so bad,” Donald Trump fumed. Trump: \"Somalia has come in here — what they've done to our country, these people — they've come into our country, and what they've done with that fake congresswoman. She's so bad.\" pic.twitter.com/SX5idZqV3R— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 10, 2026 “The leader of the Pedophile Protection Party is trying to deflect attention from his name being all over the Epstein files,” Omar wrote to her 2.7 million followers. “At least in Somalia they execute pedophiles not elect them.” Trump has attacked Omar multiple times in recent months. Last month, he mocked her for quoting the Constitution and said she hates Jewish people. Omar brushed off his latest attack and instead focused on the POTUS’ latest scandal. Trump’s name appears more than one million times in the unredacted Epstein files, according to Rep. Jamie Raskin, who reviewed the documents. Raskin said he searched “Trump,” “Donald,” and “Don” in the Justice Department database and got over a million results. One document contradicts Trump’s claims about Jeffrey Epstein. A 2009 email shows Epstein telling Ghislaine Maxwell that Trump said he “never” asked Epstein to leave Mar-a-Lago. Trump has repeatedly claimed he kicked Epstein out of his Florida club for inappropriate behavior. The Epstein files also reveal that Trump acted as a whistleblower in the mid-2000s investigation. Former Palm Beach police chief Michael Reiter told the FBI that Trump called him when the Epstein probe became public in July 2006. “Thank goodness you’re stopping him, everyone has known he’s been doing this,” Trump told Reiter, according to FBI documents dated April 23, 2020. Trump also said Maxwell was “evil” and told police to “focus on her.” Trump claimed he “got the hell out of there” when he saw teenagers around Epstein.", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "allhiphop.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770838440, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "2b749586339b144ff72edaa9ea152e7134026116", "post_id": "https://rapindustry.com/?p=62335", "source": "rss", "event_type": "item", "title": "French Montana x Max B – ‘Bulletproof Maybach’", "body": "The post French Montana x Max B – ‘Bulletproof Maybach’ first appeared on Rap Industry: New Hip Hop, Rap Videos, Music, News, & more..", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "rapindustry.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770838459, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "79b169409f511ee11aa9470a9f5136751edeb357", "post_id": "https://rapindustry.com/?p=62325", "source": "rss", "event_type": "item", "title": "Gunna – ‘wgft’ ft.

The artist will perform at GelreDome in Arnhem, Netherlands, on June 6, 2026. This marks his first European concert since 2014. That’s a 12-year gap for fans across the continent. The announcement comes as Ye rebuilds his career after years of controversy. He’s been making moves internationally over the past year. In January, he sold out Mexico City’s Monumental Plaza de Toros. The show drew over 40,000 fans for his first major performance there in 18 years. Mexico’s shows prove that demand for Ye’s live performances remains strong. Now he’s bringing that energy to Europe. GelreDome officials expect huge demand for the Netherlands date. “This is an event of international scale and a special moment for Dutch audiences,” a venue spokesperson said. The concert comes as Ye prepares to drop his new album Bully. The project hits streaming platforms on March 20, 2026, through Gamma distribution. Bully has been delayed multiple times since its original announcement. It was first scheduled for his daughter North’s birthday in June 2025. The album represents a fresh start for the Chicago artist. He signed with independent distributor Gamma after major labels distanced themselves. Ye’s career took a major hit after antisemitic comments in 2022 and 2023. Adidas ended their billion-dollar Yeezy partnership. Other brands followed suit. But January 2026 brought a turning point. Ye published a full-page apology in The Wall Street Journal. “I am not a Nazi or antisemite. I love Jewish people,” he wrote in the ad. He attributed his behavior to a four-month manic episode linked to bipolar disorder. The apology came after inpatient treatment in Switzerland. Ye said he started medication and therapy to address his mental health. “I regret and am deeply mortified by my actions in that state,” the statement read. He committed to accountability and meaningful change. Vanity Fair journalist Anna Peele interviewed Ye about the apology. She asked if it was just a PR move before his album release. Ye denied commercial motives. He said he felt genuine regret and remorse weighing on his spirit. The Netherlands show will test European appetite for his return. It’s his first time back since the Yeezus tour over a decade ago. Another European date is planned for July 18 in Reggio Emilia, Italy. But the Netherlands show opens this limited European run. India is also reportedly in talks for April 2026 dates. That would mark another historic moment for live music in that market. Ye’s live performances are known for massive production values. His artistic vision creates unique experiences that fans remember for years. Tickets for the GelreDome show are expected to sell fast when they go on sale February 13.", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "allhiphop.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770846162, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "0bc2120c1dc2c5ec5a287d08e3fab61c6d344b2e", "post_id": "https://www.xxlmag.com/?p=1002725", "source": "rss", "event_type": "item", "title": "Why These 25 Rappers Are in Jail or Prison Right Now", "body": "Here are rappers caught up in the legal system.

The U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, Jeanine Pirro, brought the indictment claiming that the lawmakers were violating a federal law prohibiting the interference in the morale and discipline of the U.S. armed forces. Her office didn’t respond to requests for comment after the news broke. The charges stemmed from a video first organized by Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst, which was released as the Trump administration began to carry out strikes against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and contemplated deploying active-duty troops to curb protests in American cities. “Our laws are clear,” said Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, a former astronaut. “You can refuse illegal orders.”", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "hiphopwired.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770846169, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "5870a63a9713c925380ea5ddf6670849d4cb263c", "post_id": "at://did:plc:ixewrhdvouywuezj7ydb3vob/app.bsky.feed.post/3memfwd5c7k2i", "source": "bluesky", "event_type": "item", "title": "Bluesky discussion: Jospa on #hiphop", "body": "Their take: Have you checked out my new signle \"Antilalos\" yet?\n\nSpotify: open.spotify.com/track/6DHmUR...\n\nYoutube: youtu.be/ayv16cLQzow?...\n\nCover by @animanitari.bsky.social as always!\n\n#rap #hiphop #spotify #youtube #single #jospa #antilalos #art #music", "comments": [], "heur": 70.0, "priority": 70.0, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770846175, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "69b38c1a48e0eb83bcd4a786056d51e2ec2acbdc", "post_id": "at://did:plc:q2uiehz5skrxvornrqr3a4tm/app.bsky.feed.post/3memf6zbmlk2e", "source": "bluesky", "event_type": "item", "title": "Bluesky discussion: The SpitSLAM Record Label Group on #hiphop", "body": "Their take: 3 years ago (yesterday). #djtootuff #hiphop #tuffcrew #spitslamrecords \n\nfound.ee/M5BVh9", "comments": [], "heur": 70.0, "priority": 70.0, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770846176, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "a525662121005806883e504175957b1937562a08", "post_id": "at://did:plc:aaprk55vkrhb5og4ev4cwe3u/app.bsky.feed.post/3memeqvjdpy2n", "source": "bluesky", "event_type": "item", "title": "Bluesky discussion: Hot 21 Radio on #hiphop", "body": "Their take: ▶️ #NowPlaying on Hot 21 Radio: \nThe Last B-boy by Jingle\n\n🔥 Tune in now: \nhttps://www.hot21radio.com \n\n#Hot21Radio #HipHop #RnB #WeTheBestHipHopandRnB\n\nUpcoming: Show - The Last B-boy, Reggie Smith \"The Boss\"", "comments": [], "heur": 70.0, "priority": 70.0, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770846176, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "095690cc8eeb69ca93d8a1d30ece090d96d71aa3", "post_id": "at://did:plc:aaprk55vkrhb5og4ev4cwe3u/app.bsky.feed.post/3memekbmcj22n", "source": "bluesky", "event_type": "item", "title": "Bluesky discussion: Hot 21 Radio on #hiphop", "body": "Their take: ▶️ #NowPlaying on Hot 21 Radio: \nTrap Queen by Fetty Wap\n\n🔥 Tune in now: \nhttps://www.hot21radio.com \n\n#Hot21Radio #HipHop #RnB #WeTheBestHipHopandRnB\n\nUpcoming: Jingle - The Last B-boy", "comments": [], "heur": 70.0, "priority": 70.0, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770846176, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "2602cc6bb22b2efea9ac174fa7ea92c967ecff52", "post_id": "at://did:plc:nbhkzsipg67246pedo5n5qnb/app.bsky.feed.post/3memeiftb2s2k", "source": "bluesky", "event_type": "item", "title": "Bluesky discussion: Orbit News Hub on #hiphop", "body": "Their take: The King of Compton conquered the Crescent City! 👑🏟️\n\nOur latest piece breaks down Kendrick Lamar's historic Super Bowl LIX performance.

Cole album was great (not a classic though), but this post isn't meant to defend or even discuss the Cole album. It's just meant to spark a discussion about the expecations placed on rappers today and how artists like Kanye and Kendrick influenced those expectations.**\n\nTwo common complaints I've seen about the J. Cole album are that his lyrics are often too straightforward and surface level, and that he safe with his sound with little experimentation compared to his past works. I want to start with talking about lyricism and how Kendrick has potentially impacted what we consider to be top-tier lyricism in mainstream rap.\n\nFrom the moment he arrived on the scene, Kendrick had a very unique pen and delivery, telling familiar stories in a relatively unconventional way. \"I hope the universe love you today, 'cause the energy we bring is sure to carry away, a flock of positive activists that fill your body with hate, if it's necessary.\" That's a pretty interesting way to describe riding around looking for trouble, and decidedly less conventional (imo) than how that would be described by other greats like Nas, Jay-Z, Em, etc.\n\nAnd this is why we love Kendrick and part of what makes him so great. His dense, heady, and sometimes esoteric lyricism creates music that lends itself to be dissected, discussed, and debated. But because of this, I feel like we sometimes expect all lyrics-forward rappers to have a similar level of depth and abstractness applied to their concepts, even when this wasn't expected of previous greats like Nas, Jay, Em, Andre, Mos Def, etc.\n\nThis isn't to say that those rappers don't have depth, but their writing is typically quite a bit more straightforward even when they're mixing in double entendres and other devices. Sure, Nas and Jay have lyrics that lend themselves to being studied and dissected, but it's also pretty easy to grasp what they're talking about on your first listen. They don't require dissection to enjoy. Part of what makes them so great is their ability to explore concepts and use complex rhyme schemes in an easily digestible way. Everyone who listens to NY State of Mind or D'Evils or Ms. Jackson can gather exactly what is being said on first listen, but these are still incredible songs with great lyricism. Now when rappers explore a certain concept, I feel like they're often unfairly compared to in-depth way Kendrick has done it on songs like U, Auntie Diaries, Crown, etc, when that type of in-depth exploration and complexity has never really been a prerequisite for great rap music in the past. (I may be totally off on this, but that's just how I see it).\n\nAnd I feel that Kanye has had a similar effect on production side of things. Because Kanye switched up his style so often, other rappers are expected to do so even when that's not in their lane. There is no grand change in style between Reasonable Doubt and American Gangster, no huge style change between It Was Written and Life is Good.\n\nKanye and Kendrick are fantastic artists, two of my favorite of all time, but I also think their grand, sprawling albums (sonically and lyrically, respectively) have created something of an unfair standard for rappers who don't take huge artistic swings. Obviously I'm referring to J. Cole here, but I've seen similar criticisms lobbied at plenty of artists too.\n\nSorry for the long write-up, just something that's been on my mind, wanted to see if you guys had any thoughts about this?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r182he", "subreddit": "rap", "author": "Paula-Abdul-Jabbar", "score": 54, "comments": 66, "created_utc": 1770746582.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770846192, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "0d0b440da836fe6d06681ad628e4b750619c5207", "source": "reddit", "title": "The Fall Off - far better on second listen.", "body": "I think the first time I was on what you might call Banger Watch, just looking for the best beats and the radio hits.

Cole album was great (not a classic though), but this post isn't meant to defend or even discuss the Cole album. It's just meant to spark a discussion about the expecations placed on rappers today and how artists like Kanye and Kendrick influenced those expectations.**\n\nTwo common complaints I've seen about the J. Cole album are that his lyrics are often too straightforward and surface level, and that he safe with his sound with little experimentation compared to his past works. I want to start with talking about lyricism and how Kendrick has potentially impacted what we consider to be top-tier lyricism in mainstream rap.\n\nFrom the moment he arrived on the scene, Kendrick had a very unique pen and delivery, telling familiar stories in a relatively unconventional way. \"I hope the universe love you today, 'cause the energy we bring is sure to carry away, a flock of positive activists that fill your body with hate, if it's necessary.\" That's a pretty interesting way to describe riding around looking for trouble, and decidedly less conventional (imo) than how that would be described by other greats like Nas, Jay-Z, Em, etc.\n\nAnd this is why we love Kendrick and part of what makes him so great. His dense, heady, and sometimes esoteric lyricism creates music that lends itself to be dissected, discussed, and debated. But because of this, I feel like we sometimes expect all lyrics-forward rappers to have a similar level of depth and abstractness applied to their concepts, even when this wasn't expected of previous greats like Nas, Jay, Em, Andre, Mos Def, etc.\n\nThis isn't to say that those rappers don't have depth, but their writing is typically quite a bit more straightforward even when they're mixing in double entendres and other devices. Sure, Nas and Jay have lyrics that lend themselves to being studied and dissected, but it's also pretty easy to grasp what they're talking about on your first listen. They don't require dissection to enjoy. Part of what makes them so great is their ability to explore concepts and use complex rhyme schemes in an easily digestible way. Everyone who listens to NY State of Mind or D'Evils or Ms. Jackson can gather exactly what is being said on first listen, but these are still incredible songs with great lyricism. Now when rappers explore a certain concept, I feel like they're often unfairly compared to in-depth way Kendrick has done it on songs like U, Auntie Diaries, Crown, etc, when that type of in-depth exploration and complexity has never really been a prerequisite for great rap music in the past. (I may be totally off on this, but that's just how I see it).\n\nAnd I feel that Kanye has had a similar effect on production side of things. Because Kanye switched up his style so often, other rappers are expected to do so even when that's not in their lane. There is no grand change in style between Reasonable Doubt and American Gangster, no huge style change between It Was Written and Life is Good.\n\nKanye and Kendrick are fantastic artists, two of my favorite of all time, but I also think their grand, sprawling albums (sonically and lyrically, respectively) have created something of an unfair standard for rappers who don't take huge artistic swings. Obviously I'm referring to J. Cole here, but I've seen similar criticisms lobbied at plenty of artists too.\n\nSorry for the long write-up, just something that's been on my mind, wanted to see if you guys had any thoughts about this?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r182he", "subreddit": "rap", "author": "Paula-Abdul-Jabbar", "score": 56, "comments": 67, "created_utc": 1770746582.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770846781, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "2f5d5cb85216e18afc7e3adfe7c85a0cd702347d", "source": "reddit", "title": "The Fall Off - far better on second listen.", "body": "I think the first time I was on what you might call Banger Watch, just looking for the best beats and the radio hits.

The Hip-Hop power couple sat down with 1075 WGCI to discuss their new book The Way Love Goes. The legendary rapper admitted she wasn’t feeling the book idea at first. “I wasn’t with it at first,” Da Brat told WGCI. “I was like, ‘Hell no, I don’t want to do it.'” But Judy convinced her to share more with their fans. The writing process became therapeutic for both women. They opened old wounds that needed healing. “We like went deep and we didn’t hold nothing back from the situation,” Da Brat explained about their honest approach. Judy Dupart wanted Da Brat to understand her full earning potential. “If it’s not compromising your morals, you know, take a little bit of your time, why not?” Judy said during the interview. Their love story started in an Atlanta studio back in 2017. Judy showed up to meet Da Brat after a business event. The entrepreneur came alone, which surprised the rapper. “Child, she showed up to the studio by herself,” Da Brat recalled. Judy arrived looking stunning with her hair, outfit, jewelry and nails on point. She even brought protection with her. The moment that changed everything came when Judy made her intentions clear. “So she goes, ‘I’m interested in you,'” Da Brat remembered. That confession completely threw off the usually confident rapper. “I had never had that happen to me before,” Da Brat admitted. “It messed me up. It messed me up real bad. Knocked me off my square. Lost all my swag.” The physical reaction was intense. Da Brat tried drinking Hennessy but spilled it on her shirt. She had butterflies and felt nauseous. She even accidentally burned JD’s couch while smoking. “I lost all my swag and I just felt like, you know, from now on, I want I wanted to explore and see what we could be,” Da Brat explained about that pivotal moment. Judy was ready to follow Da Brat’s lead completely. “If she was in the closet, I was gonna go in there with her,” Judy said about respecting Da Brat’s privacy needs. “I was letting her lead, you know, the speed of our relationship.” The couple discussed their fertility journey and the challenges they faced. When they tried IVF, genetic testing narrowed their donor options significantly. “As soon as we put in my seven things, we had no black people available,” Judy explained about the limited choices. They faced serious backlash online for their donor selection. “We had death threats on our child,” Judy revealed about the internet harassment they endured.

The Hip-Hop legend’s bodyguards got into it with Dutch speed skating icon Marianne Timmer backstage at Milano Speed Skating Stadium. Timmer was waiting to interview Dutch athletes after the men’s 1000-meter race when Snoop Dogg and his crew came through. The three-time Olympic champion said one of the rapper’s security guards shoved her against a wall. “I was standing against a wall, and one of the security guards pushed me even closer,” Timmer told Dutch outlet Sportnieuws. “I said, ‘Just act normal’, it’s a really wide hall, about four metres. But then the guy came back and I said, ‘What? Do I have to go through that wall or something?'” The 54-year-old Long Beach native is making bank as Team USA’s first-ever honorary coach. NBC reportedly paid him $500,000 per day during the 2024 Paris Olympics, with his total earnings hitting $15 million. His Winter Olympics deal likely tops that number. But Snoop’s feel-good Olympic story hit a snag when his security got aggressive. Timmer said the guard came back at her after she told him to chill. “I said something mean back: ‘I’m not here waiting for Snoop Dogg, I’m waiting for Jennings de Boo. We want to see Joep (Wennemars), we want to talk to Kjeld (Nuis) for a moment.'” Timmer said Snoop’s security team had been causing problems all day. She watched them rough up a Dutch fan earlier on the stadium’s upper level. “We saw a Dutchman being roughly escorted away from the stands by some very large security guards,” she added. “I could just picture myself being grabbed by the neck and thrown out. That would have been a great story.” The rapper hasn’t commented on the incident yet.

The climb happened because people on both sides of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement debates started using his track in social media videos. The Florida rapper had no clue his song was trending again until he started scrolling through TikTok and other platforms. “I honestly had no idea. You know, I could never imagine,” Vanilla Ice told WPBF 25 News. “You know, I just woke up one day and found out that my song is number one. 36 years later and I’m like, whoa. So I’m ready to go dancing again,” he said. Protesters against ICE operations have been playing “Ice Ice Baby” at rallies across the country. Videos show masked activists blasting the song from speakers during demonstrations in Bristol and other cities. One viral clip shows a black pickup truck driving past immigration advocates while playing the track at full volume. Meanwhile, ICE supporters have created their own content using the same song. Social media users on both sides of the immigration debate have turned the 1990 hit into soundtrack material for political videos and memes. Vanilla Ice said he welcomes any attention that drives his music but wants to stay out of political fights. “Hey, man, I’ll take anything that drives my songs. You know, whatever makes people laugh and have fun because that’s all they’re doing is using it for little parodies and stuff like that,” he said. The rapper made clear he won’t pick sides in immigration debates. “I would never try to even comment on how to run a country, so I don’t. I’m neutral, you know, I don’t do anything. I stay in my lane, if that makes sense,” Vanilla Ice explained. The neutral stance kind of matches his approach to other political situations. Vanilla Ice performed at Donald Trump’s Mar-A-Lago New Year’s Eve parties on December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2025. But, he bashed Amber Rose and Forgiato Blow for ripping off his hit to create their abysmal Pro-Trump track, “Trump, Trump Baby.” “Ice Ice Baby” originally sampled the bassline from Queen and David Bowie‘s 1981 hit “Under Pressure” without permission. The unauthorized sampling prompted legal action by both artists and their representatives. Vanilla Ice initially denied copying the bassline during interviews. He claimed his version was different because it had an extra note. The explanation didn’t hold up under legal scrutiny. The rapper eventually settled the lawsuit out of court. Years later, he revealed he paid $4 million to purchase the publishing rights to “Under Pressure.” He said buying the rights was cheaper than fighting the case in court. The purchase gave Queen members and Bowie songwriting credits on “Ice Ice Baby.” This means Vanilla Ice now earns money from both his original rap and the underlying “Under Pressure” composition whenever the song gets played or streamed.

She then sang a snippet of “La Cucaracha” before making her stance clear. “If ICE come in here we’re gonna jump their a####,” Cardi B told the California audience. “I’ve got some bear mace in the back. They ain’t taking my fans.” DHS didn’t let the threat slide. The agency fired back on X with a pointed reference to her past legal troubles. “As long as she doesn’t drug and rob our agents, we’ll consider that an improvement over her past behavior,” DHS posted. Cardi B quickly responded by shifting the conversation to more serious allegations. She tweeted back about the Epstein files and questioned why those investigations weren’t getting the same attention. “If we talking about drugs let’s talk about Epstein and friends drugging underage girls to rape them,” she wrote. “Why yall don’t wanna talk about the Epstein files?” What a weak “clapback.”The only reason the “Epstein files” are out is because of President Trump. Trump arrested Epstein during the first term and just released millions of files.Your friends Jay-Z and TMZ founder Harvey Levin are mentioned in the files, any comment? https://t.co/QPJWPMl92J— Alex Bruesewitz (@alexbruesewitz) February 12, 2026 Alex Bruesewitz, former top adviser for President Trump’s 2024 campaign, wasted no time attempting to sow division between the two rappers. “The only reason the ‘Epstein files’ are out is because of President Trump. Trump arrested Epstein during the first term and just released millions of files.Your friends Jay-Z and TMZ founder Harvey Levin are mentioned in the files, any comment?” Bruesewitz fumed. Then, he started retweeting Nicki Minaj’s social media posts in support of the Save America Act. Minaj spent Thursday urging her fans to call senators and push for the passage of Trump’s SAVE Act. The legislation requires a photo ID and proof of citizenship to vote. It passed the House 218-213, but faces an uphill battle in the Senate. “Dear Barbz, call your senators, then tweet #SaveAct to let me know you did it,” Nicki Minaj posted to her millions of followers. Minaj even offered bribes to get fans involved. The White House reposted her video with the message “Barbz- find your senators.” Barbz- find your senators:https://t.co/yTd5j5Srr1 https://t.co/VIFn5b3RSk— The White House (@WhiteHouse) February 12, 2026 Minaj’s support for the SAVE Act puts her at odds with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. He called the legislation “Jim Crow 2.0” and said it would be “dead on arrival” in the Senate. Minaj fired back in all caps, telling Schumer to “stop weaponizing Jim Crow & the Holocaust in your political theater.” She accused him of protecting unauthorized immigrants to “cheat American citizens out of fair elections.” QUEEN May I just add this one lil tidbit…BLACK PPL have ID b/c they know their black ass is more likely to be pulled over or stopped in the street!!! STOP using black ppl & married women in your shenanigans and say what you really mean! You really mean ILLEGAL… https://t.co/aWNwBo5fL4— Nicki Minaj (@NICKIMINAJ) February 12, 2026 The political divide between the two rappers adds new fuel to a rivalry that dates back years. Their beef has included everything from social media arguments to a physical altercation at a 2018 fashion week party. Cardi B’s tour continues through April with a March 12 stop in Minneapolis. That city has seen ICE and Border Patrol agents kill two American citizens this year during protests against federal immigration enforcement. The Trump administration announced Thursday it’s ending the surge of immigration agents sent to Minnesota. The decision came after months of protests and the shooting deaths of two citizens who opposed the federal presence.", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "allhiphop.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770988400, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "f8c237ceb597593ec9aa2a91bccf6fe993af1325", "post_id": "https://www.xxlmag.com/?p=1078822", "source": "rss", "event_type": "item", "title": "Cardi B Fires Back at Department of Homeland Security, ICE Reacts", "body": "Cardi melts ICE.

In case you missed it, Blizzard Entertainment has rolled out spotlights for its biggest franchises, Overwatch, Hearthstone, and Diablo. Overwatch is currently enjoying a resurgence after ditching the 2 in its title, essentially hitting the reset button, while introducing 5 new heroes out of the 10 coming this year, as well as other improvements and quality of life updates. Diablo announced that a new class, the Warlock, will be introduced across multiple games, including Diablo II: Resurrection, Diablo Immortal, and Diablo IV. Oh, and we can’t forget, after taking a brief hiatus, BlizzCon is coming back, and it’s poised to be bigger and better than before. HHW Gaming traveled to Blizzard Entertainment headquarters to chop it up with Johanna Fairies about her company’s big year. Step into that conversation below. The Return of BlizzCon MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images HHW Gaming: BlizzCon is back. What can fans expect this year that they were not expecting? Since it took a year off, what can fans expect when they come this year and see what’s going on? Johanna Faries: Yeah. We’ve been working super hard to make sure that we deliver a bold, awesome gathering, well, for fans and for players. It’s all about community, that’s what it’s always been about for BlizzCon, but I do think having a couple of years to really think about what do we announce, how do we surprise, how do we delight, how do we go big in the right spaces, but how do we make sure that we keep our clear communities front and center, right? The goal will be, hopefully, people feel like, “Oh, I’m reconnecting with my lifelong friends,” or, “I’m making new lifelong connections by virtue of this gathering space.” And at the same time, I was really floored by what Blizzard devs and teams had to announce on behalf of the organization. So, if we can do both of those things and really put on a great show, I think we’ll be pretty proud. BlizzCon 2026 Will Feature The Inaugural Blizzard Classic Cup BlizzCon 2026 features the inaugural Blizzard Classic Cup for titles like StarCraft and Heroes of the Storm. Does this represent a renewed long-term commitment for these legacy titles, or is it specifically a tribute for the anniversary year? We really just thought about, again, back to the community, and for people who’ve been going to BlizzCons for many, many years, or what can we do to make sure that this is a really awesome experience for those who have seen BlizzCon in many different forms over the decades. We knew that a Classic Cup would be something, hopefully, that the community could enjoy, and our esports experiences across the board, I think, really are a mass set of what makes a great BlizzCon sing in addition to all the other experiences that we’re going to bring forward. So, it was really about, “Hey, if we’re going to deliver in the right way, what do we think our communities will want to see?” And that was part and parcel of some of the outcomes in terms of what we’re putting together. Johanna Faries Wants Blizzard To Be Strategic Andy Wenstrand You set a goal for Blizzard to deliver one or two really big things every calendar year. After the integration with Microsoft, what structural changes have you implemented to ensure that this reliable cadence of launches without compromising the Blizzard brand? One of the things that I talk about a lot, and now, I think we’re seeing become a rhythm for how we organize our thinking, is planning. It’s not all that exciting a word, but I think in practice, we’ve talked about, “Let’s be strategic in not only our big swings creatively, and obviously, the world-class game experiences we want to bring forward for communities worldwide, but also, let’s make sure we’re really aligned on what we want to do, when we want to do it. No one size fits all. What’s true for one franchise might need to look really different for one of our other game franchises and universes, but let’s make sure we have a rhythm. Let’s take a long lens, know where we’re going multiple years out. Let’s be agile in the moment to make sure we can meet players where they are and make pivots accordingly.” But this sense of planning and being really thoughtful and cross-functional has been a muscle that is really important to me, and I think there’s really strong fruit when we’re doing it in a coordinated way. Blizzard Will Continue To Create Nuanced, Deep, Rich Characters and Worlds Blizzard Entertainment Now, you’ve spoken about the need for more nuanced and diverse lived experiences in the dev room for create better stories. How was this philosophy manifesting in the upcoming World of Warcraft: Midnight Expansion and/or new characters we might see in other games like Overwatch? We’re always thinking about how do we create nuanced, interesting, deep, rich characters and worlds, right? And that’s been, I think, a signature for Blizzard over the many… 35 years now and counting. It will continue to be something we think about, right? How do we represent deep, layered, multidimensional story arcs and character arcs? Our players are as nuanced and sophisticated as the universes we build, and I think it’s really an honor to be able to see how our devs, our writers, our storytellers, our worldbuilders, come together and continue to raise the bar on that. So, you can expect that across every franchise because, again, I just think that’s part of the core secret sauce of what makes Blizzard really a powerhouse creatively. The Development Teams On Blizzard IP Are Flourishing Blizzard Entertainment Johanna Faries Says “No Idea Is Off Limits” Regarding Blizzard’s IP Blizzard Entertainment With dedicated spotlights on games like Diablo, Hearthstone, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft happening right now, which franchise do you believe is currently undergoing the most radical modernization to fit 2026? I’ll be honest, I feel like every one of our teams continues to push the boundaries, and it’s not always big equals bold, right? It’s really just about how we make sure we are continuing to shape bold trajectories for our IP. And again, this, “No one size fits all. Let’s make sure we’re bespoke.” What’s true for Hearthstone over the next months or years needs to be true for Hearthstone players and our Hearthstone community, and so, too, for Overwatch and all of our other IP. So, all the teams are really rising to that challenge. This also intersects back to the planning piece, creating spaces for people to feel empowered, to have bold discussions, to learn about what’s worked, what isn’t working, to really make sure that we’re continuing to break the mold. “No idea is off limits, but once we align to something, let’s make sure we’re supporting it and giving it the full weight of what Blizzard can bring.” The teams are flourishing in that regard in terms of big ideas. Johanna Faries Says Blizzard Is Just Focused On Current IP Blizzard Entertainment You’ve hinted that your franchise heads need to know exactly where they’d be in three years from now. Without spoiling any surprises for summer, how much of Blizzard’s future involves the new places and new territories, and new IP versus the continuous scaling universes? Right now, we are really focused on our existing IP, and the reason for that is that it has created strategic clarity, but we also believe that there’s so much more room and territory to unlock, even within our existing IP. I say this often, and I believe it, to have a portfolio this strong, this battle-tested in many ways over the decades, is just such a signature strength for Blizzard. There’s more we can continue to do, and I think teams are really excited about continuing to go deep. It doesn’t take anything else off the table, but it allows focus, right? And so, in the near-term, three, four years, that will be the primary focus, but again, no bad idea, right? We’re continuing to think, “Where do we want to be a decade from now? What’s going to be required then might be a different strategy than what’s required in the near-term. Let’s make sure we’re parallel pathing those opportunities.” I think Blizzard players, existing and new, will get a sense of bold trajectory and a dynamism across the portfolio that we’re pretty excited about.", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "hiphopwired.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770988409, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "b127b87328d7a5fe3bc4d15b230be9bbcbaf913d", "post_id": "https://hiphopwired.com/?p=3041005", "source": "rss", "event_type": "item", "title": "French Montana & Max B “Bulletproof Maybach,” Boosie Badazz “Fashion Nova” & More | Daily Visuals 2.12.26", "body": "Source: Edward Berthelot / Getty Max B’s been home for a minute now and as of late has been churning out new work on the regular to re-establish himself as a problem in the rap game and helping him get him back in the flow of things has been his day-one, French Montana.

He meditates on this memory, turning it into the official trailer for the album — watch here! The artist has been able to build substantial interest in the project especially upon the release of his latest song with Chief Keef & NBA YoungBoy titled ‘Rooms’. Now, he aims to put his own spin on the Atlanta sound by enlisting new collaborators and completely reimagine his contribution to pushing sonic boundaries in hip hop.

Yes, the artist has finally released the Icon album on all streaming platforms. The 10-track project is just the right length for what may be defined as the slowing down of life in the fast lane, facilitated by Brent’s proclivity for relaxing, sensual flows over laidback beats. The album opens with ‘white noise.,’ a track that effectively avoids any vocal performance. In a bold opener, the artist literally let the music speak for itself, before ever attempting to put a word together. The song titles are interesting too, and do not begin with capitalised first letters as one would otherwise expect them to. Instead, they stand out like parts of broken sentences, each ending with a ‘period.’ Perhaps there is something to be said about being thrust in the middle of an idea, with the end intact, denoted deliberately with a ‘.’ Thematically, the artist explores intimacy, meditates on the sensory, reflects on his time with partners & often captures the complexity of romantic relationships.

The night felt like a true milestone for the group, with longtime fans filling the venue ready to relive the music that helped define independent hip-hop in the early 2000s. Slug and Ant delivered a strong and focused performance. Ant’s production hit hard through the speakers, giving each track a warm, classic feel. Slug’s delivery was sharp and emotional, moving easily between personal storytelling and crowd-hyping moments. The setlist covered different eras of their catalog, but the Lucy Ford songs stood out the most. Fans rapped along, turning the anniversary into a shared experience between the group and the crowd. Even 25 years later, the music still feels honest and relevant. The supporting artists added solid energy to the night. Sage Francis brought a thoughtful and lyrical set, delivering a rememberable performance. His performance was steady and focused, drawing the audience in with strong wordplay. R.A. the Rugged Man raised the intensity with fast flows and high energy. He moved across the stage and kept the crowd engaged from start to finish. Kool Keith added his own unique style to the lineup. His delivery was unconventional and memorable, reminding fans why he has remained an important figure in underground hip-hop. Overall, the Winter Carnival Tour stop in Los Angeles felt like a celebration of longevity and loyalty. Atmosphere proved why they continue to headline stages after all these years, while the supporting artists helped make the night complete. Sage Francie – by Loe Kee Phlicks R.A.

Becoming a fan of his nearly a decade ago with his 4th EP Sweet Dreams along with the Big Ghost Ltd. produced full-length debut Aguardiente that next spring, his profile in the underground grew exponentially from there. Discography standouts include the DJ Skizz-produced Wet Dirt, the DJ Muggs-produced Medallo, Cartagena, Breakfast in Hradec, Sin Cortar, El León produced by Preservation, the official Aguardiente sequel Bazuko, the Mello Music Group-backed This, Is Not That produced by Apollo Brown, Rose Gold & more recently the V Don produced Bulletproof Chicken. Last we heard from him was Hanzai this past Black Friday & he’s back with the Evidence-produced War Cash. “Last Day” hooks up a drumless piano loop to get us started talking about no diamond district having the capability of cooling him off now that the fire’s been lit leading into “Dr. Scholl’s” taking a slicker approach to the beat spraying the foot care product as if he’s graffiti writing. “Ventilation” goes for a wavier vibe assuring he retained his soul after updating his mind leading into “Karachi” embracing a boom bap direction to capture the aura of those who wound up falling flat. Blu makes my favorite guest appearance of the 2 on “Pinto” likening their pens to pistols over a funky beat while “Roy” strips the drums again talking about God & the agencies being the only things he fears. “2 Left Feet” returns to the boom bap speaking of poppin’ in the jungle on a weekly basis while “Rio” featuring Monday Night talks about the possibility of showin’ up to the capital of Brazil at some point before 2026 ends. “Green Room” ends the War Cash exchange bodying 1 last instrumental recalling a time where he was chillin’ backstage killin’ time until his set. Hanzai wasn’t my favorite album Crimeapple dropped last year per se & I definitely wouldn’t place it in the hierarchy of his lengthy discography by any means, but War Cash comes merely less than 24 hours since it was announced with the most I’ve enjoyed a new project from him since Bulletproof Chicken last fall. Evidence’s production is a huge step-up from Hanzai’s varying between boom bap or drumless, suiting Crime’s mafiosi tales a lot more consistently.

The album itself debuted at #1 on the US Billboard 200 selling 566 000 copies and has since been certified as Diamond double album selling 5 887 630 copies in the United States.\n\nSince *All Eyez On Me* was released under the Death Row Records 2Pac now got features from the other artists on the label. Dr. Dre was featured on the \"California Love\" single and had produced the song as well as remix of it and the first track of the second disc \"Can't C Me\". He had two features by both Snoop Doggy Dogg and Nate Dogg who were both featured on \"All About U\". Snoop was featured also on \"2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted\" and Nate on \"Skandalouz\". Tha Dogg Pound were also prominent on the album both Daz and Kurupt featuring on \"Got My Mind Made Up\", Kurupt featuring on \"Chech Out Time\" and Daz producing five tracks for the album which is second most after Johnny \"J\" who had produced 11 tracks. Notable about features is also that \"Got My Mind Made Up\" has feature verses by Method Man and Redman but also originally had verses by Inspectah Deck and The Lady Of Rage.\n\nTo this day *All Eyez On Me* remains 2Pac's best selling album.\n\n**Tracklist:**\n\n***Disc 1***\n\n*01 Ambitionz Az A Ridah* **\\[Prod.

Cole is heavily misunderstood amongst hip hop fans", "body": "This post from r/rap is getting significant traction with 161 upvotes and 268 comments. I’ve been thinking about why J. Cole gets such polarized reactions, and I honestly think a lot of it comes down to category confusion.\n\nSometimes Cole raps in a way that sounds like he wants to be placed in the “conscious / conceptual” lane — the Kendrick, Nas, Lupe, Black Thought type of bracket. When he touches on social issues, introspection, or morality, people naturally start comparing him to those artists.\n\nBut if you really look at most of Cole’s catalog, his core style isn’t built around dense conceptual frameworks or abstract writing. A lot of his music follows a simpler structure: pick a topic (often his life, success, guilt, relationships, growth), and then rap extremely well about it. Strong bars. Clean rhyme schemes. Clear messaging. Personal storytelling. But not necessarily layered conceptual execution in the way Kendrick or Lupe might do it.\n\nAnd I think that’s where the tension starts.\n\nThe “Cole haters” often judge him as if he’s competing directly with the most conceptual, abstract lyricists. When you measure him against that specific standard, he can feel like he falls short.\n\nBut I don’t actually think that’s his lane.\n\nHe feels more like he sits somewhere between bar-heavy rappers and introspective mainstream artists, closer to a Lil Wayne or Jay Z in terms of approach. Not abstract for abstraction’s sake. Not concept-first. More about rapping well on relatable themes and making it digestible.\n\nOnce you stop expecting Cole to be this ultra-deep, triple-layered conceptual rapper, his music becomes way more enjoyable. You start appreciating the clarity, the consistency, the technical ability, and the relatability instead of waiting for some hidden metaphor that might not even be the point.\n\nI think that’s actually why he built such a strong fanbase. His core fans aren’t constantly trying to force him into the “greatest conceptual mind in rap” debate.

ABOUT LUDA: The career of the multi-talented CHRIS “LUDACRIS” BRIDGES can best be described as remarkable. As a recording artist, he has sold more than 24 million albums worldwide, thanks to the blockbuster success of such singles as “Stand Up,” “Get Back,” “Southern Hospitality,” “Number One Spot,” “Money Maker,” and “My Chick Bad.” All these records were accompanied by ingenious videos that demonstrated Bridges’ far-reaching imagination and his willingness to stretch the boundaries of what rap videos should look and feel like. With an unrivaled match of lyrical acumen, wit, and imagery, Ludacris has solidified himself as one of music’s premier entertainers. His versatility and artistic complexity also enabled him to make a seamless transition to acting, including the fan-favorite role of “Tej” in Universal Pictures’ box office phenomenon Fast & Furious franchise, where he was first introduced in 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003). He recently reprised his role for the seventh time in Fast X, released May 20, 2023, while simultaneously hitting the road with Janet Jackson to perform his greatest hits during the 33-city Together Again tour — once again proving himself to be a true, modern-day Renaissance man. His other notable film credits include Garry Marshall’s ensemble comedy New Year’s Eve, Ivan Reitman’s romantic comedy No Strings Attached, Paul Haggis’s Crash (which received an Academy Award for Best Picture in 2006), and Hustle & Flow (which earned Bridges a SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture). He also starred alongside Lil Rel in the Christmas comedy Dashing Through the Snow. As a father of four girls, his latest ventures fittingly include launching an educational platform devoted to the enrichment of children called KidNation. In addition, Bridges created the animated series KARMA’S WORLD, which debuted in Netflix’s Top 10 in 42 countries, received two NAACP Award nominations, and is currently awaiting its fifth season. The show — a coming-of-age story for children ages 6–9 about a young Black girl finding her voice — was inspired by Chris’s oldest daughter, Karma, and is based on the interactive educational website of the same name created by Karma’s World Entertainment in 2009. A consummate businessman, Ludacris is enjoying success outside of entertainment. One of his most successful ventures includes opening his long-anticipated restaurant Chicken-n-Beer at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Airport, and most recently, at LAX in Los Angeles. Bridges’ philanthropic efforts rival his entertainment accomplishments. He founded The Ludacris Foundation in 2001, focusing on empowering youth in his hometown of Atlanta. He has also partnered with No Kid Hungry and Feeding America, further amplifying his commitment to making a difference. This October marks the 25th anniversary of Ludacris’ groundbreaking debut album Back for the First Time — a milestone that not only celebrates his legacy but also sets the stage for what’s next. To commemorate this incredible achievement, Ludacris recently delivered an epic, legendary performance at One Music Fest, where he brought out a star-studded lineup including Usher, LL Cool J, Fergie, Chingy, Shawna, Bobby V, Jadakiss, Jeezy, and I-20. In honor of this major career milestone, he is also planning a new anniversary tour that will reconnect fans with the music, energy, and creativity that have defined his journey from day one.The post Ludacris to Headline Performances at NBA All-Star 2026. first appeared on Rap Industry: New Hip Hop, Rap Videos, Music, News, & more..", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "rapindustry.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770988428, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "10ab87ce289a6b433e9e5673b675d13f432b7532", "source": "reddit", "title": "What do you even call this new genre of rap songs", "body": "Safety - The new Jcole album \n\nGang Gang Gang - Jack Harlow\n\nAuntie Diaries - Kendrick Lamar\n\n  \nAll of these songs are like the same vibe on rappers who are like someone from my childhood is lgbt or a bad person song on one of their recent albums after having alot of established songs.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r1jb5s", "subreddit": "rap", "author": "Footarm", "score": 0, "comments": 12, "created_utc": 1770772263.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770988428, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "11f6a2557ff3aaf14c10c6d2df9f399859c6ba31", "source": "reddit", "title": "Discussion: J.Cole, Kanye, Kendrick and the expectation of the modern rap artist", "body": "**Disclaimer: I thought the J. Cole album was great (not a classic though), but this post isn't meant to defend or even discuss the Cole album. It's just meant to spark a discussion about the expecations placed on rappers today and how artists like Kanye and Kendrick influenced those expectations.**\n\nTwo common complaints I've seen about the J. Cole album are that his lyrics are often too straightforward and surface level, and that he safe with his sound with little experimentation compared to his past works. I want to start with talking about lyricism and how Kendrick has potentially impacted what we consider to be top-tier lyricism in mainstream rap.\n\nFrom the moment he arrived on the scene, Kendrick had a very unique pen and delivery, telling familiar stories in a relatively unconventional way. \"I hope the universe love you today, 'cause the energy we bring is sure to carry away, a flock of positive activists that fill your body with hate, if it's necessary.\" That's a pretty interesting way to describe riding around looking for trouble, and decidedly less conventional (imo) than how that would be described by other greats like Nas, Jay-Z, Em, etc.\n\nAnd this is why we love Kendrick and part of what makes him so great. His dense, heady, and sometimes esoteric lyricism creates music that lends itself to be dissected, discussed, and debated. But because of this, I feel like we sometimes expect all lyrics-forward rappers to have a similar level of depth and abstractness applied to their concepts, even when this wasn't expected of previous greats like Nas, Jay, Em, Andre, Mos Def, etc.\n\nThis isn't to say that those rappers don't have depth, but their writing is typically quite a bit more straightforward even when they're mixing in double entendres and other devices. Sure, Nas and Jay have lyrics that lend themselves to being studied and dissected, but it's also pretty easy to grasp what they're talking about on your first listen. They don't require dissection to enjoy. Part of what makes them so great is their ability to explore concepts and use complex rhyme schemes in an easily digestible way. Everyone who listens to NY State of Mind or D'Evils or Ms. Jackson can gather exactly what is being said on first listen, but these are still incredible songs with great lyricism. Now when rappers explore a certain concept, I feel like they're often unfairly compared to in-depth way Kendrick has done it on songs like U, Auntie Diaries, Crown, etc, when that type of in-depth exploration and complexity has never really been a prerequisite for great rap music in the past. (I may be totally off on this, but that's just how I see it).\n\nAnd I feel that Kanye has had a similar effect on production side of things. Because Kanye switched up his style so often, other rappers are expected to do so even when that's not in their lane. There is no grand change in style between Reasonable Doubt and American Gangster, no huge style change between It Was Written and Life is Good.\n\nKanye and Kendrick are fantastic artists, two of my favorite of all time, but I also think their grand, sprawling albums (sonically and lyrically, respectively) have created something of an unfair standard for rappers who don't take huge artistic swings. Obviously I'm referring to J. Cole here, but I've seen similar criticisms lobbied at plenty of artists too.\n\nSorry for the long write-up, just something that's been on my mind, wanted to see if you guys had any thoughts about this?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r182he", "subreddit": "rap", "author": "Paula-Abdul-Jabbar", "score": 62, "comments": 70, "created_utc": 1770746582.0, "mode": "hot", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770988428, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "a94bbf16e126f5414aff34f8c534f21684999739", "source": "reddit", "title": "Trying to find a rap song — chorus says something like “they tryna kill me but I’m already dead”", "body": "I’m trying to find a rap song I heard on Spotify DJ last week and it’s been stuck in my head.\n\nHere’s what I remember:\n\nTwo rappers on the track\n\nModern sound (probably 2019–2024)\n\nGritty vibe, not melodic or emo\n\nTheme about betrayal / switching sides / being hunted\n\nChorus had something close to:\n\n“they tryna kill me but I’m already dead”\n\nor “they tryna kill me but I’m already gone”\n\nI also vaguely remember a line about telling his mom or referencing his mother\n\nIt’s NOT Juice WRLD, XXXTentacion, or Kodak Black.

Every piece he creates speaks to that – story first, everything else follows” – Wonderland ‘I AM.’ mixtape artwork Today, Victor Ray releases the ‘I AM.’ mixtape, a collection that brings together all of his EPs to date, alongside two brand new songs: ‘You & I’, released late last year, and ‘Disappear’, revealed today alongside its beautiful accompanying visual, exploring themes of love and identity, directed by **. Produced by THRDL!FE, the new single is Victor’s own take on contemporary R&B, delivered with a voice for the ages. Together, the new tracks offer a tantalising glimpse of where Victor is creatively as he completes work on his highly anticipated debut album. The release also arrives as Victor has been selected by Mr Porter as one of the musicians to watch in 2026. Bringing together all four of Victor’s EPs — i was., i felt., I TRIED. and I WILL. — into one cohesive body of work makes it clearer than ever just what a singular talent Victor is. His consistently jaw-dropping vocal ability, combined with an innate gift for storytelling across multiple projects, confirms that he is not only a perfect pop star for Gen Z, but also a truly timeless artist. Speaking about the mixtape, Victor says: “To be able to bring all the EPs together in one place feels like closing a chapter. Each project was a moment in my life, and seeing them side by side reminds me how much I’ve experienced and grown, not just musically, but as a person. This mixtape is really about telling this complete story, from ‘hollow’, my first song, which I wrote in my mum’s house years ago, all the way to ‘You & I’, created at EastWest Studios in LA with one of my dream producers — Bekon. What’s exciting is that it’s also setting the runway for what’s next. And there is so much coming next. I feel more focused and fearless than ever going forward, and just so proud to have this mixtape embodying the start of my journey.” ‘I AM.’ stands as both a defining statement of Victor Ray’s journey so far and a powerful signal of a star stepping into his full global potential. ‘I AM.’ Mixtape tracklisting: Hollow Sink or Swim Like The Moon A Little Less Lonely Off Balance Stay For A While It Only Cost Everything Sticks and Stones Popcorn and a Smoothie Falling Into Place Halfway There Contagious Still The Same Lose Myself Comfortable Disappear Hearts Break and People Change You & I World At My Feet", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "hiphop411.tv", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770988439, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "1969b95366a56f1f4166fa0e79cfa9281716b4cd", "post_id": "https://hiphop411.tv/?p=903796", "source": "rss", "event_type": "item", "title": "FRESHBYCADDY Releases Brand New Single, ‘Oh Nah Nah’", "body": "Listen to Oh Nah Nah here Friday, 13 February 2026, Johannesburg – Multifaceted South African Entertainer, Teboho “CADDY” Tsotetsi, better known as FRESHBYCADDY, has released his highly-anticipated new music offering titled ‘Oh Nah Nah’ – the perfect blend of different sounds with a dreamy, feel-good and cool message of love, expression and freedom.

CJ Wallace recently told a judge that Jonathan Hay has been dodging process servers in his defamation case against the publicist, who made wild claims against Wallace and Diddy. Hay is knee deep in two legal actions. He claims Diddy beat him and forced his penis into Hay’s mouth during a 2020 studio session tied to a remix project honoring The Notorious B.I.G., while Wallace allegedly stood in the background helping make it happen. Hay says the Bad Boy mogul masked him, assaulted him and then sexually violated him, accusing Wallace of “conspiring” with Diddy to “allow or assist” him ability to carry out the attack. He also accuses Diddy of a separate 2020 “freak off” style incident during a photoshoot, telling police Diddy pulled out his penis, told Hay to “come finish him off,” then ejaculated on a shirt that once belonged to Biggie before tossing it on Hay and saying, “Rest in peace BIG.” That California case is moving forward in Los Angeles to determine if criminal charges could be warranted against Diddy. As for Wallace, he denied the claims and filed a defamation lawsuit against Hay, who went public with claims that CJ himself had sexual relationships with Diddy, took part in “freak offs” with the mogul and his own co-producer Willie Mack, and lured Hay into a location so Diddy could attack him. Hay told interviewers that Wallace attended Diddy’s infamous “freak-off” gatherings, watched criminal sexual activity and used his proximity as Biggie’s son to help set Hay up. Wallace and Biggie’s estate says all of that is fiction, cooked up after they refused to release most of Hay’s 2020 “Ready to Dance” remixes. Wallace’s new motion says he has tried at least seven times to serve Hay since November 12, 2025. During one attempt, Hay’s daughter allegedly said he moved out in May 2025 and cut off contact. Process servers made three more attempts on January 7, 8, and 9, 2026, and Wallace’s lawyer, Jeremiah Reynolds, says they even asked Hay’s attorney to accept service by email, but counsel refused.

But DaBaby shut down those plans fast. He posted on X last month saying, “anything mentioning my name & politics right now is fake news.” The Charlotte rapper told fans, “Don’t take the bait” regarding rumors about the political event.

That left Pearson scrambling for a replacement headliner. Enter Waka Flocka Flame. View this post on Instagram The Atlanta rapper has been vocal about his support for Donald Trump for years. He attended the film “Melania” premiere with President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump in January. “Hopefully, you find love in a hopeless place,” Pearson said about the Valentine’s event. “And there’s no place more hopeless than Washington, D.C.” Pearson runs the Cruel Kids Table, a group of young Trump supporters. His Black Conservative Federation calls itself “the premier hub for Black conservatives.” The organization has been pushing conservative values in Hip-Hop spaces. DaBaby’s team initially agreed to the performance contract. But they changed course after the rapper faced online backlash. Pearson addressed DaBaby directly on his show after the denial. “A lot of folks in Hollywood and rap have handlers,” Pearson said. “DaBaby, only you know what is best for you. They want to control you, DaBaby. Don’t let them.” The Valentine’s Day party will feature music, food, and political discussions. Organizers expect hundreds of attendees from across the country.

This phenomenon of cheating was highlighted especially during the Kendrick-Drake beef, where botting allegations continue to cast doubt on artist reputation aside from straight up monetary profit. Addressing the problem as a fairness-first platform, Apple Music has come out with increased penalties towards such fraudulent activity. Back in 2023, Apple Music had already claimed to have diminished these practices by 30% after having imposed penalties just a year before. A conversation The Hollywood Reporter had with Apple Music’s platform chief Oliver Schusser reveals that fines were being imposed on a sliding scale, where penalty ranged from 5% to 25%. Now, after having doubled the imposition, the penalty is anywhere between 10% to 50%. The report even breaks it down in simpler terms, stating that “…in layman’s terms, if you engage in streaming fraud amounting to say, $1 million, you’d be fined a maximum $500,000.” And of course, the fraudulent streams will not be eligible for monetisation. “This is a zero-sum game,” says Schusser. “I would like to live in a world where we have zero fraud on the platform, and this has been a very effective tool. Increasing the penalties takes the money from people who are cheating and puts it back into the system for those who aren’t.” The new sanctions seem to be a step in the right direction — what do you think?The post Apple Music To Impose Double Penalty Over Streaming Frauds first appeared on HipHop-N-More.", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "hiphop-n-more.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770988673, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "cd8edeaa75ff09cd1df908b4a02fac09a0509fc1", "post_id": "https://undergroundhiphopblog.com/?p=1447847", "source": "rss", "event_type": "item", "title": "Truelove Produces Sam R I’s Conceptual 6th EP “Stained Glass” (EP Review)", "body": "This is the 6th EP from San Diego, California emcee/producer Sam R I.

He would later have William Bostick fully produce his debut album 12 Monkeys towards backend of 2024 after Bostick heard Sam’s verse on “Rise in Winter Crime (Brrrrr)” & a couple months succeeding an eponymous EP, he’s enlisting Truelove to handle all of Stained Glass’ beats. We get 93 seconds of drumless rap rock vibes talking about him walking down a “Cold Path” just before things lean towards a boom bap vibe instrumentally explaining that he can’t deal with “Tha Pressure” of setting for less. “Dice Kream Man” shifts into more soulful territory showing a sensual side to Sam topically leading into “Paint the Picture” ominously pointing out the observation of kids these days inhibiting our feet with clips in a piece instead of sitting on beaches. “Turf War Kids” after the “Stained Side” interlude chops up a vocal sample to represent his turf now while “Words from an O.G.” ruggedly suggests to take off before he breaks off. Willie Marshall appears on “Fly Away” soulfully talking about seeing death at a young age in the slums & after “Cloud City” featuring Apoc Krysis finds the 2 teaming up for another hardcore boom bap joint, “What If?” soulfully ends the EP telling the love of his life that all he wants is her. 12 Monkeys was an excellent gateway for anyone who hadn’t heard of Sam R I since it still embodies who he is today & those who were impressed by that LP as much as I was will certainly have to give Stained Glass a spin whenever the chance comes this weekend. It’s more conceptual than Sam’s inaugural full-length, cohesively describing 3 journeys coming out of 3 different cities & the production is still boom bap-oriented although there are secondary influences of drumless, rap rock & chipmunk soul.

However as a fan of both MCs since high school, Salvation for the Wicked had me thinking we’d be in for the greatest extended play of 2026 so far. “Sinners” begins with a crossover between gangsta rap & drumless talking about how some people don’t have integrity these days whereas “Forgiveness” embraces a heavier rap rock vibe instrumentally asking for their shawties to forgive them before the liquor attacks their kidneys. “Collection Plates” featuring Young Chris finds the trio soulfully talking about their preference of catching plays than cases while “Offerings” shifts towards a jazzy boom bap direction to speak of making money. O.T. the Real joins Boldy & Ran on “Field of Nightmares” stripping the drums again to talk about letting people run their mouths so they can run the streets of their respective hometowns & making elusive moves just before the celebratory “Leather Sandals” suggesting those who have wreaks stomachs should stay the fuck away from their kitchens. The final song “16 Tithes” ends Salvation for the Wicked with a blend of crooning chipmunk soul & jazz rap spitting intricate 16s each continuing to detail the life of a gangsta.

Instead, according to its unique governance and operating principles, after deducting expenses, ASCAP then distributes remaining dollars as royalties to its songwriter, composer and music publisher members. In 2025, ASCAP increased the value and monetization of its members’ music with domestic revenue from US-licensed performances totaling $1.471 billion, an increase of 5.3%, or $74 million, year-over-year. Revenues from streaming audio, radio and general licensing drove the increase. Collections from foreign revenue for the exploitation of the public performances of the ASCAP repertory also increased to a total of $474 million, up by $36 million, or 8.2%. The record high of $1.759 billion available for royalty distributions included $1.304 billion from US-licensed and administered performances, with $37 million distributed through Songwize, ASCAP’s royalty administration service provided to ASCAP members who directly license their works. Distributions from public performances outside of the US grew to $455 million, a 10.6% increase over 2024. In the last 10 years of ASCAP’s strategic growth plan, 2015 – 2025, ASCAP has generated a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for total revenue of 6.7%; and for total distributions, a CAGR of 7.3%. ASCAP CEO Elizabeth Matthews said: “ASCAP remains a powerful advocate for creators facing an increasingly uncertain economy and rapidly shifting music landscape. While creators are under attack globally by disruptive technologies and opportunistic private businesses, ASCAP’s sole focus is to serve our members. We deliver on that mission every single day.” ASCAP Chairman of the Board and President Paul Williams said: “ASCAP once again delivered historic record-breaking revenues and distributions. We showed the world that our fierce commitment to putting creators first is our number one imperative. Songwriters know they belong at ASCAP and that we always have their back.” In 2025, ASCAP welcomed over 80,000 new members as the total membership surpassed 1.1 million. Among the top music creators who switched to ASCAP from other PROs in 2025 were EJAE, Rosé, The 1975, Lola Young, Myles Smith, Johnny Marr, Boy George, Michael Pollack, Tyler Johnson, Robin Carolan and Daniel Blumberg, among many others. ASCAP represents and aggregates copyrights in cost-effective, efficient blanket licenses from the most iconic music creators in the world, including Beyoncé, Billy Joel, Cardi B, Chappell Roan, Charli XCX, Chris Stapleton, Dua Lipa, Garth Brooks, Jay-Z, Jimi Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, Katy Perry, Lil Baby, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Marc Anthony, Mariah Carey, Neil Young, Olivia Rodrigo, Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder and Usher, among many others.The post ASCAP Announces Record Breaking Revenue of $1.9B and Highest Ever Royalty Distributions of $1.75B for 2025. first appeared on Rap Industry: New Hip Hop, Rap Videos, Music, News, & more..", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "rapindustry.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770988687, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "fa61a317cc02da06677cf091b30e1a7b65492261", "post_id": "https://rapindustry.com/?p=62339", "source": "rss", "event_type": "item", "title": "2026 BET Awards Heading Back To Los Angeles.", "body": "The BET awards are coming back to Los Angeles.

The single was released worldwide on 12 February 2026, perfectly timed ahead of Valentine’s Day. Originally released in 2010, Sinzia became one of East Africa’s most enduring love songs, a soundtrack to romance, longing and emotional vulnerability for an entire generation. NASINZIA II revives this timeless narrative, blending nostalgia with modern Afrosoul and Afro-pop elements, smooth melodies and heartfelt lyricism crafted for today’s global audience. Nameless, one of Kenya’s most celebrated and influential artists, is widely regarded as a pioneer of modern East African pop music. With a career spanning over two decades, his songwriting and vocal delivery have shaped the region’s romantic soundscape, making Sinzia a cultural milestone that continues to resonate across generations. Marioo represents the new wave of Tanzanian music, known for his emotive storytelling, smooth vocals and consistent chart-topping releases. His ability to fuse vulnerability with contemporary African sounds has earned him widespread acclaim, making him the perfect collaborator to reintroduce Sinzia through a fresh, youthful lens. Together, Nameless and Marioo create a seamless cultural and musical bridge between Kenya and Tanzania. NASINZIA II is more than a remake, it’s a celebration of legacy, evolution and the enduring power of love stories told through African music. The single is accompanied by a music video that is also out now.

The platform doubled its penalties for fake streams. Fraudsters now face fines up to 50% of their would-be royalties. That’s up from the previous 25% cap. Oliver Schusser, Apple Music’s VP, told The Hollywood Reporter the move targets a growing problem. The service caught 2 billion fraudulent streams in 2025 alone. “This is a zero-sum game,” Schusser said. “I would like to live in a world where we have zero fraud on the platform, and this has been a very effective tool.” The new penalties started Sunday. Apple Music first introduced fraud fines in 2022 with a sliding scale from 5% to 25%. Now those numbers jump to a minimum of 10% and a maximum of 50%. Here’s how it works: If someone games the system to claim $1 million in fake royalties, they could face a $500,000 fine. Plus, those bogus streams won’t earn any money. AI music is making the problem worse. French streaming service Deezer reported that 60,000 AI-generated songs are uploaded daily. That’s 39% of all new music on their platform. Even worse, 85% of AI-generated song streams are fake. Apple Music’s fraud rate remains under 0.5%. But with billions of total streams, that still adds up fast. The 2 billion fake streams Apple caught last year would have cost real artists about $17 million. Schusser says most competitors struggle with this issue. Apple Music’s advantage comes from iOS security and human editors who curate playlists. They don’t rely solely on algorithms, as other platforms do. The company validates every single play on Apple Music. When they find fraud, they remove the stream counts and chart positions. The money goes back to honest artists instead. “Increasing the penalties takes the money from people who are cheating and puts it back into the system for those who aren’t,” Schusser explained. The timing connects to AI music flooding streaming services. Scammers use AI to quickly create fake songs. They build networks of fake artists and playlists to drive streams. Some avoid detection by spreading their plays across many tracks rather than focusing on just a few. Apple Music won’t say when fines become permanent bans. The company didn’t respond to questions about upgrading penalties to straight removal from the platform. The streaming wars keep heating up over fraud detection. Apple Music positions itself as the quality choice compared to ad-supported competitors. Schusser took shots at free music tiers, calling them part of the problem. “You’ve got the wrong incentives in the market about people trying to get number one songs and charts,” he said. “It’s not good for our ecosystem.” The 50% penalty cap sends a clear message to would-be fraudsters. Apple Music won’t tolerate fake streams, especially as AI makes cheating easier than ever.", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "allhiphop.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770988945, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "90d3c1e7525225c0a53a3ec86a8a7393053cd40a", "post_id": "https://allhiphop.com/?p=6125593", "source": "rss", "event_type": "item", "title": "DHS Rips Cardi B Over ICE Comments With Wild Roast", "body": "The Department of Homeland Security just served Cardi B some ice-cold payback. DHS officials clapped back at the rapper’s concert threat with a brutal reminder of her stripper past. Cardi B made headlines Wednesday night during her Little Miss Drama Tour opener in Palm Desert, California. She told fans she’d fight ICE agents if they showed up at her show. “B####, if ICE comes in here, we gon’ jump they a####,” Cardi said from the stage. She even mentioned having bear mace ready backstage. But DHS wasn’t having it. The agency’s official X account said they’d consider her threat “an improvement over her past behavior” as long as she doesn’t “drug and rob our agents.” As long as she doesn’t drug and rob our agents, we’ll consider that an improvement over her past behavior. https://t.co/P9wqWk416L— Homeland Security (@DHSgov) February 12, 2026 That’s a direct shot at Cardi’s 2019 controversy. An old video resurfaced showing her admitting to drugging and stealing from men when she was an exotic dancer. She said she would bring clients to hotel rooms to “drug them up” and then rob them. The backlash was swift back then. Cardi initially defended herself but later apologized in a lengthy statement on X. She explained she did things she felt were necessary to survive at the time. “I made the choices I did at the time because I had very limited options,” Cardi B wrote. She said she was focused on being a better person for herself and her family. DHS clearly remembered those admissions. Their response shows they’re not backing down from Cardi’s tough talk about immigration enforcement. The rapper has been vocal about ICE under the Trump administration. She praised Bad Bunny for speaking out against ICE at the 2026 Grammys. The Puerto Rican star said “ICE out” while accepting his award. “If ICE come in here we’re gonna jump they a**es.”— Cardi B during her first night of her ‘Little Miss Drama’ tour.pic.twitter.com/91LNBV96QK— Pop Base (@PopBase) February 12, 2026 Cardi’s concert outburst came while she performed “La Cucaracha.” She climbed onto an elevated platform and asked if any Guatemalans or Mexicans were in the audience. The crowd erupted when she made her ICE threat. “I’ve got some bear mace in the back! They ain’t taking my fans, b####,” she yelled. The audience cheered throughout her anti-ICE rant. Her tour runs through April 17 with stops at major venues nationwide. The next show is scheduled for February 14 in Las Vegas. She’ll wrap up in Atlanta on April 17.

Fires Back At 50 Cent Online Amid VERZUZ Chatter", "body": "T.I. is reportedly gearing up to release his upcoming studio album, Kill The King, and he’s made it clear that this will be his final project. In the midst of T.I.’s impending retirement and VERZUZ chatter, an older clip of Tip calling out 50 Cent for a song-for-song battle resurfaced, with the pair exchanging words online. Nuface shared a 2020 clip on Instagram of T.I. in the studio, on a phone call with Kevin Hart, urging the comedian to contact 50 Cent so they could stage a battle of their hit songs. In the video, Tip spoke confidently on behalf of all southern Hip-Hop, stating that artists from the region fail to garner respect from their northern counterparts. In the comments section, 50 Cent posted the reply “King Rat,” pointing to a moment where T.I. pinned a gun charge on a deceased cousin, which Lil Boosie also called out in 2023. T.I. caught wind of the reply and fired back with one of his own. “You playing on MY NAME when only one of us a rat in real life…you know I got your paperwork right?” T.I. said. “And my transcript is available online. Your excuses is useless. Get yo ho ass in the box or STFU and live in fear. You soft son. You’ve lost my respect.” If fans know anything about 50 Cent, he’s surely going to reply to T.I. in his typical fashion. However, we doubt this gets the pair closer to holding the VERZUZ battle many have been clamoring for for years. — Photo: Getty", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "hiphopwired.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770988952, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "317e57caa4f7fe8e6e1a5493dca81bdef7f41735", "post_id": "https://hiphopwired.com/?p=3040292", "source": "rss", "event_type": "item", "title": "Drake’s “Warehouse” Merch Goes Valentine’s Mode With Amazon Music", "body": "Source: Drake’s Warehouse / Amazon.com Drake is keeping his foot on the gas when it comes to creative rollouts.

Cole Responds To Cam’ron’s Lawsuit Over ‘Ready ’24,’ Requests Judge For Dismissal", "body": "After much silence on the matter and constant probing and public appearances & accusations by Cam’ron, J. Cole has finally taken to responding to Cam’ron in a legal manner. For the uninitiated, Cam’ron sued J. Cole over claims of not receiving fair compensation or credit for Cam’s feature on ‘Ready ’24.’ What was more shocking, however, was also the mention of Cole not appearing as a guest on Cam’ron’s podcast after allegedly promising to make an appearance. The latter certainly seems like an odd thing to sue someone for, but Cam’ron embarked on that route anyway, even clarifying his sentiment in a recent interview & voicing his frustration. Now, J. Cole has, by obligation, responded legally to the artist. The North Carolina rapper has asked the judge to consider the request for a complete dismissal of the case. According to filings made by Cole’s lawyers this week, it was stated that Cam’ron was never promised a podcast appearance (and certainly not as part of a deal made for ‘Ready’24.’) In fact, check out this excerpt from the filing: “[Cam’ron] asked Cole to appear on his podcast, and he and Cole discussed the possibility of Cole appearing on plaintiff’s podcast, but no commitment was ever made by Cole to do so nor was there any agreement or condition related to ‘Ready ‘24’ to do so.” The filings also deny the accusations in relation to the song in question, stating that Cam’ron approved the feature, benefitted from it, and only began demanding things outside the scope of the collaboration upon release. More specifically, “It was only after the release of ‘Ready ‘24’ that he began to demand unreasonable conditions never agreed to by Cole, or an excessive fee inconsistent with industry standards for a featured performance…” The post J.

Cole is heavily misunderstood amongst hip hop fans", "body": "This post from r/rap is getting significant traction with 163 upvotes and 268 comments. I’ve been thinking about why J. Cole gets such polarized reactions, and I honestly think a lot of it comes down to category confusion.\n\nSometimes Cole raps in a way that sounds like he wants to be placed in the “conscious / conceptual” lane — the Kendrick, Nas, Lupe, Black Thought type of bracket. When he touches on social issues, introspection, or morality, people naturally start comparing him to those artists.\n\nBut if you really look at most of Cole’s catalog, his core style isn’t built around dense conceptual frameworks or abstract writing. A lot of his music follows a simpler structure: pick a topic (often his life, success, guilt, relationships, growth), and then rap extremely well about it. Strong bars. Clean rhyme schemes. Clear messaging. Personal storytelling. But not necessarily layered conceptual execution in the way Kendrick or Lupe might do it.\n\nAnd I think that’s where the tension starts.\n\nThe “Cole haters” often judge him as if he’s competing directly with the most conceptual, abstract lyricists. When you measure him against that specific standard, he can feel like he falls short.\n\nBut I don’t actually think that’s his lane.\n\nHe feels more like he sits somewhere between bar-heavy rappers and introspective mainstream artists, closer to a Lil Wayne or Jay Z in terms of approach. Not abstract for abstraction’s sake. Not concept-first. More about rapping well on relatable themes and making it digestible.\n\nOnce you stop expecting Cole to be this ultra-deep, triple-layered conceptual rapper, his music becomes way more enjoyable. You start appreciating the clarity, the consistency, the technical ability, and the relatability instead of waiting for some hidden metaphor that might not even be the point.\n\nI think that’s actually why he built such a strong fanbase. His core fans aren’t constantly trying to force him into the “greatest conceptual mind in rap” debate. They connect with the honesty and the execution.\n\nCurious what others think, is Cole miscategorized, or do you think he actually belongs in that Kendrick/Nas/Lupe bracket?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r2j4cg", "subreddit": "rap", "author": "sypher07070799", "score": 163, "comments": 268, "created_utc": 1770868142.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770988973, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "9692df65973574a6914f23a1a70cf4ea81b537f7", "source": "reddit", "title": "How is he still dropping?", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r2fsua", "subreddit": "rap", "author": "Puzzled_Physics2213", "score": 22, "comments": 10, "created_utc": 1770858985.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770988973, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "d0d2aaa1e56044e78f52789d4636f93a5ce546f1", "source": "reddit", "title": "T.I's new single \"Let em know\"", "body": "This song is 🔥 the beat and his flow in this song takes you right back to 00s southern rap.

Cole album was great (not a classic though), but this post isn't meant to defend or even discuss the Cole album. It's just meant to spark a discussion about the expecations placed on rappers today and how artists like Kanye and Kendrick influenced those expectations.**\n\nTwo common complaints I've seen about the J. Cole album are that his lyrics are often too straightforward and surface level, and that he safe with his sound with little experimentation compared to his past works. I want to start with talking about lyricism and how Kendrick has potentially impacted what we consider to be top-tier lyricism in mainstream rap.\n\nFrom the moment he arrived on the scene, Kendrick had a very unique pen and delivery, telling familiar stories in a relatively unconventional way. \"I hope the universe love you today, 'cause the energy we bring is sure to carry away, a flock of positive activists that fill your body with hate, if it's necessary.\" That's a pretty interesting way to describe riding around looking for trouble, and decidedly less conventional (imo) than how that would be described by other greats like Nas, Jay-Z, Em, etc.\n\nAnd this is why we love Kendrick and part of what makes him so great. His dense, heady, and sometimes esoteric lyricism creates music that lends itself to be dissected, discussed, and debated. But because of this, I feel like we sometimes expect all lyrics-forward rappers to have a similar level of depth and abstractness applied to their concepts, even when this wasn't expected of previous greats like Nas, Jay, Em, Andre, Mos Def, etc.\n\nThis isn't to say that those rappers don't have depth, but their writing is typically quite a bit more straightforward even when they're mixing in double entendres and other devices. Sure, Nas and Jay have lyrics that lend themselves to being studied and dissected, but it's also pretty easy to grasp what they're talking about on your first listen. They don't require dissection to enjoy. Part of what makes them so great is their ability to explore concepts and use complex rhyme schemes in an easily digestible way. Everyone who listens to NY State of Mind or D'Evils or Ms. Jackson can gather exactly what is being said on first listen, but these are still incredible songs with great lyricism. Now when rappers explore a certain concept, I feel like they're often unfairly compared to in-depth way Kendrick has done it on songs like U, Auntie Diaries, Crown, etc, when that type of in-depth exploration and complexity has never really been a prerequisite for great rap music in the past. (I may be totally off on this, but that's just how I see it).\n\nAnd I feel that Kanye has had a similar effect on production side of things. Because Kanye switched up his style so often, other rappers are expected to do so even when that's not in their lane. There is no grand change in style between Reasonable Doubt and American Gangster, no huge style change between It Was Written and Life is Good.\n\nKanye and Kendrick are fantastic artists, two of my favorite of all time, but I also think their grand, sprawling albums (sonically and lyrically, respectively) have created something of an unfair standard for rappers who don't take huge artistic swings. Obviously I'm referring to J. Cole here, but I've seen similar criticisms lobbied at plenty of artists too.\n\nSorry for the long write-up, just something that's been on my mind, wanted to see if you guys had any thoughts about this?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r182he", "subreddit": "rap", "author": "Paula-Abdul-Jabbar", "score": 61, "comments": 70, "created_utc": 1770746582.0, "mode": "hot", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770988974, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "9029ea3f1b0cd0699bb5124cbea8c39c610bb53c", "source": "reddit", "title": "Trying to find a rap song — chorus says something like “they tryna kill me but I’m already dead”", "body": "I’m trying to find a rap song I heard on Spotify DJ last week and it’s been stuck in my head.\n\nHere’s what I remember:\n\nTwo rappers on the track\n\nModern sound (probably 2019–2024)\n\nGritty vibe, not melodic or emo\n\nTheme about betrayal / switching sides / being hunted\n\nChorus had something close to:\n\n“they tryna kill me but I’m already dead”\n\nor “they tryna kill me but I’m already gone”\n\nI also vaguely remember a line about telling his mom or referencing his mother\n\nIt’s NOT Juice WRLD, XXXTentacion, or Kodak Black.

Kelly Thrown In The Hole Over Prison Infraction, Leaving Lawyers Stunned", "body": "R. Kelly is sitting in “the hole” at a North Carolina federal prison while his lawyers push claims of an assassination plot, a suspicious overdose and government misconduct in his bid for a new trial. Kelly is serving a 30-year federal sentence from his New York racketeering and sex trafficking conviction, along with a separate 20-year Chicago sentence for child pornography and enticement, most of which runs at the same time. He is currently housed at the Federal Correctional Institution in Butner, North Carolina, where prison officials recently transferred him to the Special Housing Unit over what court filings describe as an undisclosed infraction. In federal prison slang, the Special Housing Unit is known as “the hole,” a segregated wing where inmates spend up to 23 hours a day locked in a cell under tight restrictions. Placement in the SHU sharply limits phone access, in-person visits and access to legal materials, and it is typically used for disciplinary reasons or pending investigations into alleged rule violations. AllHipHop has learned that R. Kelly’s attorney, Beau Brindley, traveled to Butner to review evidence connected to Kelly’s motion for a new trial and to prepare a required reply brief. Brindley told the court that roughly 30 minutes before he arrived for a scheduled legal visit, prison officials placed Kelly in the Special Housing Unit without explaining the alleged infraction. When Brindley finally met with his client, he wrote that Kelly lacked access to his legal documents, making it impossible to review the evidence or prepare the filing. The disruption came as Kelly moved for a new trial in Chicago federal court, accusing prosecutors of misconduct. He claims that Bureau of Prisons officials conspired to have him killed inside the federal prison system. AllHipHop broke the original story: R. Kelly’s legal team alleges that members of the Aryan Brotherhood were approached and offered incentives to assassinate him. According to the singer, a high-ranking gang member refused to carry out the alleged plan and indicated he would be willing to testify about the approach if necessary. Kelly’s attorneys also describe what they characterize as an attempted overdose that occurred after he was placed in solitary confinement within the facility. They allege that he was given medication in a quantity that triggered a medical emergency, leading to his transport to Duke University Hospital for treatment. Doctors treated R. Kelly for blood clots in his lungs and legs, according to the filings and his lawyers contend that officials later removed him from the hospital and returned him to isolation. Kelly previously asked the court for immediate release while his new trial motion is pending, arguing that the alleged threats and medical issues place his life in danger. A federal judge denied that request for release, and prosecutors have dismissed the assassination and overdose claims as unfounded and unrelated to the underlying convictions. The motion for a new trial remains pending.", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "allhiphop.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770989196, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "30c8d7c8b14b51cb1051b85f0546d57090618d53", "post_id": "https://allhiphop.com/?p=6125588", "source": "rss", "event_type": "item", "title": "Ja Rule Apologizes After Viral Super Bowl Flight Clash With G-Unit Affiliates", "body": "Ja Rule apologized this week after a viral video showed him in a heated confrontation with Tony Yayo and Uncle Murda aboard a Delta flight from San Francisco to New York following Super Bowl LX, an incident that reignited his long-running feud with associates of 50 Cent. READ ALSO: New Footage Shows Ja Rule Ready To Scrap With Tony Yayo On Plane The Queens rapper addressed the controversy after video surfaced showing him in a heated exchange with Tony Yayo and Uncle Murda aboard a Delta flight from San Francisco to New York City following Sunday’s championship game. A fellow passenger recorded the confrontation and shared it with TMZ, igniting fresh online debate about one of Hip-Hop’s most enduring rivalries. In the clip, Ja Rule is seen standing in the aisle repeatedly shouting, “What we doing?” toward Tony Yayo, who appears to respond with profanity from his seat. Another man briefly places his hands on Ja Rule’s shoulders in what seemed to be an attempt to defuse the situation. Days later, the rapper offered a more reflective, apologetic tone. “I’m not proud of my behavior it’s goofy to me. I’m a grown man about to be a proud grandfather and I wish that video of me wasn’t out there either,” he said in a statement to ABC news. “I don’t like people taking me out of my character so for that I apologize to my wife, family, fans, business and investment partners. I want people to know at the end of the day I’m still a man and I’m going to stand my ground. I don’t start trouble.” Before that apology, Ja Rule had initially downplayed the encounter on X, calling it “hilarious” and claiming he threw a pillow at Tony Yayo during the exchange. “I popped on these punks by myself on a plane lmao…I threw the pillow at Yayo head cuz you soft,” he wrote, later sharing footage from the aircraft on Instagram Stories. Uncle Murda, a longtime associate of 50 Cent, also posted video from the plane, suggesting Ja Rule eventually exited the aircraft. In one caption he joked, “Ja got off the plane lol I took his seat.” A Delta spokesperson confirmed that crew members spoke with two passengers following a dispute and that one individual was rebooked on a later flight. The airline declined to specify which passenger departed or what prompted the disagreement. The episode quickly drew commentary from 50 Cent, who was not on the flight but reposted Uncle Murda’s footage to Instagram, writing that Ja Rule “ was by his self (sic) so he had to make a scene so they could remove his scary a##” followed by laughing emojis from Tony Yayo and Uncle Murda in the comments. The clash revives a rivalry that dates back more than two decades and has spilled from diss tracks like “Life’s On the Line” and “Loose Change” into social media jabs and public taunts. In a 2023 interview with The Shade Room, Ja Rule expressed interest in reconciliation, saying, “Life is short, I think these things can be mended.”", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "allhiphop.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770989196, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "7f61fac237dd293adf7fb63dc7a18f6d840d01f1", "post_id": "https://hiphopwired.com/?p=3041105", "source": "rss", "event_type": "item", "title": "The Web Mocks AG Pam Bondi’s Congressional Crash Out", "body": "Source: Anadolu / Getty On Wednesday (February 11), Attorney General Pam Bondi appeared before the House Judiciary Committee.

Taking to social media to celebrate Bad Bunny’s historic TV ratings for the Super Bowl halftime show, Ice-T simply wrote, “Haters can Hate….. But they ALWAYS lose….

Drawing on proprietary data from over six million tracks, the report finds that virality2 is almost impossible to achieve – and even if a track does go viral, it rarely compounds into long-term streaming income. Instead, a strategic approach that leverages optimal release timing, clear audience focus, and YouTube-led growth is a more reliable driver of catalogs that keep paying. This analysis focuses on creators earning between $100 and $350k annually and defines a durable catalog as one with an annual decay of less than 10%. Key findings from the Annual Economics Report include: Only 1.1% of tracks go viral, and achieving virality does not equal long-term success3 – 99.9% of tracks do not sustain streams after 6 months Tracks that exhibit slower, steady growth are ~60% more likely to build durable catalogs, while pursuing rapid, viral growth tends to produce short-term gains with limited longevity Artists who grow on YouTube first are 16% more likely to develop a durable catalog than those whose growth began on any other platform Independent artists who follow a frequent and strategically timed release schedule see a ~20% higher revenue compared to those who release less frequently or focus solely on standalone singles Audience concentration4 within a core country increases durability by ~50% compared to artists whose audiences are more broadly dispersed across the globe Duetti’s analysis suggests viral exposure is often tied to short-lived trends that may not fully feature the track itself, rather than sustained engagement with an artist’s broader body of work, making it difficult for those spikes to compound into durable catalog performance. “Viral moments are often over-rewarded in success narratives, but the reality is that they almost never result in longer-term financial value,” said Lior Tibon, CEO and Co-founder of Duetti. “Our report is focused on key drivers associated with developing a durable, sustainable music catalog over time.” In another finding, YouTube emerged as the strongest platform associated with early audience incubation. Artists who grow on YouTube first are 16% more likely to develop a durable catalog than those whose growth began on any other platform. This suggests that active engagement with an artist’s work on YouTube, through video content, is a leading indicator of success. The report also highlights the impact of seasonal release timing by genre, with Hip-Hop and Dance/Electronic performing best in spring, Alternative/Indie in summer, and Gospel/Christian and Country/Americana peaking in winter. Artists with three or more tracks per year earned 18% higher revenue per track, while album releases outperformed single-only strategies by 16%. “Duetti’s Music Economics Report provides actionable insights to help independent artists and songwriters make informed, long-term decisions about their careers,” said Angelo Sasso, Head of Growth at Duetti. “This data is typically reserved for large companies, and sharing it reflects our commitment to provide meaningful information to artists and their teams.” Check out the full report HERE 1Independent Artist: Over 12M artists have released music on streaming services. For the effectiveness of this report, Duetti focused on artists earning at least $100 annually and less than $350K annually in streaming income. 2 Virality: For this analysis, virality is defined as increasing streams by 5x within one month. 3 Success: Defined as achieving durable catalog performance over time. 4 High Audience Concentration: Defined as having more than 85% of listeners located within one country About Duetti Duetti is a music finance and services platform that partners with independent artists and creators.
