My goal with these articles ultimately is to help give people a bit more information about the hobby we all love, while also hopefully making for an interesting read. \n\nIf you don't know me, I'm Tom, and I've been working full-time for the last year on a sim racing coaching business, so my thoughts in this mini essay draw on the 500+ hours of coaching I’ve done in the past year. Just to say that the thoughts I’m sharing here aren't pulled from nowhere, but come from everything I’ve seen during the last year of coaching drivers of all ability levels.\n\n**Getting Stuck Behind Slower Drivers**\n\nGetting stuck behind slower drivers is one of the most common racecraft related frustrations I hear when talking to students. Maybe they’ll have an incident early in the race, or mess up qualifying and start lower down the grid than their true pace would place them. Whatever the situation that got them there, the result is the same, cruising comfortably up to a car that is clearly slower than them, closing the gap by maybe even a second per lap until they are right on the bumper of the car in front, only to spend the next 3 laps unable to actually get past the car they caught so effortlessly. Naturally this is a super frustrating situation to be in, you feel how slow they’re going, you feel how slow you’re having to go to avoid hitting them in the mid corner, but you just can’t find the gap to overtake. They’re slow on the entries, to the point that you’re worried you’ll hit them under braking, but somehow they still pull a gap on you during corner exit, and now you have no way to make a move into the next corner. Always catching on corner entry, always losing out on corner exit, and never close enough in the braking zone for anything other than an extremely aggressive divebomb that 50% of the time ends in disaster. If you’ve encountered this frustration, then this article will help make sense of the problem, and give you the answer of how to make overtaking these drivers far more effortless. The fix can be boiled down to one sentence, but I want to spend this article breaking down the steps that you need to take to implement that sentence in practice.\n\n**Stop Catching During Corner Entry**\n\nCatching a driver too quickly during corner entry is the main cause of the scenario I described above. The sequence of events looks like this;\n\nYou’re behind the slower driver, but not close enough to make a move under braking\n\nThey brake early, and you capitalize by catching them under braking, wanting to keep the car on the limit and gain as much time to the car in front as you can.\n\nThey over-slow in the mid corner, and, caught out by this, you have to quickly overslow yourself to avoid running into the back of them.\n\nOn exit, they get on throttle when they normally would, but you’ve had to check up, slow down to avoid hitting them, and judge your throttle application based on when you see them already starting to accelerate.\n\nNaturally then, you’re always going to be disadvantaged on exit, as you’re having to react to when the car in front accelerates. This is the same reason why, at a high level, parking it just slightly on the apex is such an effective strategy to defend against a faster car. \n\nSo, what should you do instead? The answer is that you don’t want to catch the car in front within the corner, but instead calm down the corner, catching only a small amount during the entry, so that you leave yourself with space to drive into during the exit. Instead of braking at your regular braking point and catching aggressively under braking, try to brake at the same time the car in front does, and modulate your braking to prevent yourself from catching too quickly. Your braking zone and entry will be under the limit, but that allows you to calm down the entry, and focus on setting up a stronger exit, by leaving space to the car in front on entry, you won’t have to react to their throttle application, instead you can begin catching during the exit, and have a pace advantage during the next straight, letting you either easily draft past them on the straight, or at least be significantly alongside by the time you reach the next braking zone, giving yourself a better chance of making the pass.\n\nHopefully this will help some people out, and if you’re not sure whether you make this mistake, watch back a couple of your races and see if you find yourself catching cars within the corner and getting worse exits as a result.

My goal with these articles ultimately is to help give people a bit more information about the hobby we all love, while also hopefully making for an interesting read. \n\nIf you don't know me, I'm Tom, and I've been working full-time for the last year on a sim racing coaching business, so my thoughts in this mini essay draw on the 500+ hours of coaching I’ve done in the past year. Just to say that the thoughts I’m sharing here aren't pulled from nowhere, but come from everything I’ve seen during the last year of coaching drivers of all ability levels.\n\n**Getting Stuck Behind Slower Drivers**\n\nGetting stuck behind slower drivers is one of the most common racecraft related frustrations I hear when talking to students. Maybe they’ll have an incident early in the race, or mess up qualifying and start lower down the grid than their true pace would place them. Whatever the situation that got them there, the result is the same, cruising comfortably up to a car that is clearly slower than them, closing the gap by maybe even a second per lap until they are right on the bumper of the car in front, only to spend the next 3 laps unable to actually get past the car they caught so effortlessly. Naturally this is a super frustrating situation to be in, you feel how slow they’re going, you feel how slow you’re having to go to avoid hitting them in the mid corner, but you just can’t find the gap to overtake. They’re slow on the entries, to the point that you’re worried you’ll hit them under braking, but somehow they still pull a gap on you during corner exit, and now you have no way to make a move into the next corner. Always catching on corner entry, always losing out on corner exit, and never close enough in the braking zone for anything other than an extremely aggressive divebomb that 50% of the time ends in disaster. If you’ve encountered this frustration, then this article will help make sense of the problem, and give you the answer of how to make overtaking these drivers far more effortless. The fix can be boiled down to one sentence, but I want to spend this article breaking down the steps that you need to take to implement that sentence in practice.\n\n**Stop Catching During Corner Entry**\n\nCatching a driver too quickly during corner entry is the main cause of the scenario I described above. The sequence of events looks like this;\n\nYou’re behind the slower driver, but not close enough to make a move under braking\n\nThey brake early, and you capitalize by catching them under braking, wanting to keep the car on the limit and gain as much time to the car in front as you can.\n\nThey over-slow in the mid corner, and, caught out by this, you have to quickly overslow yourself to avoid running into the back of them.\n\nOn exit, they get on throttle when they normally would, but you’ve had to check up, slow down to avoid hitting them, and judge your throttle application based on when you see them already starting to accelerate.\n\nNaturally then, you’re always going to be disadvantaged on exit, as you’re having to react to when the car in front accelerates.

My goal with these articles ultimately is to help give people a bit more information about the hobby we all love, while also hopefully making for an interesting read. \n\nIf you don't know me, I'm Tom, and I've been working full-time for the last year on a sim racing coaching business, so my thoughts in this mini essay draw on the 500+ hours of coaching I’ve done in the past year. Just to say that the thoughts I’m sharing here aren't pulled from nowhere, but come from everything I’ve seen during the last year of coaching drivers of all ability levels.\n\n**Getting Stuck Behind Slower Drivers**\n\nGetting stuck behind slower drivers is one of the most common racecraft related frustrations I hear when talking to students. Maybe they’ll have an incident early in the race, or mess up qualifying and start lower down the grid than their true pace would place them. Whatever the situation that got them there, the result is the same, cruising comfortably up to a car that is clearly slower than them, closing the gap by maybe even a second per lap until they are right on the bumper of the car in front, only to spend the next 3 laps unable to actually get past the car they caught so effortlessly. Naturally this is a super frustrating situation to be in, you feel how slow they’re going, you feel how slow you’re having to go to avoid hitting them in the mid corner, but you just can’t find the gap to overtake. They’re slow on the entries, to the point that you’re worried you’ll hit them under braking, but somehow they still pull a gap on you during corner exit, and now you have no way to make a move into the next corner. Always catching on corner entry, always losing out on corner exit, and never close enough in the braking zone for anything other than an extremely aggressive divebomb that 50% of the time ends in disaster. If you’ve encountered this frustration, then this article will help make sense of the problem, and give you the answer of how to make overtaking these drivers far more effortless. The fix can be boiled down to one sentence, but I want to spend this article breaking down the steps that you need to take to implement that sentence in practice.\n\n**Stop Catching During Corner Entry**\n\nCatching a driver too quickly during corner entry is the main cause of the scenario I described above. The sequence of events looks like this;\n\nYou’re behind the slower driver, but not close enough to make a move under braking\n\nThey brake early, and you capitalize by catching them under braking, wanting to keep the car on the limit and gain as much time to the car in front as you can.\n\nThey over-slow in the mid corner, and, caught out by this, you have to quickly overslow yourself to avoid running into the back of them.\n\nOn exit, they get on throttle when they normally would, but you’ve had to check up, slow down to avoid hitting them, and judge your throttle application based on when you see them already starting to accelerate.\n\nNaturally then, you’re always going to be disadvantaged on exit, as you’re having to react to when the car in front accelerates. This is the same reason why, at a high level, parking it just slightly on the apex is such an effective strategy to defend against a faster car. \n\nSo, what should you do instead? The answer is that you don’t want to catch the car in front within the corner, but instead calm down the corner, catching only a small amount during the entry, so that you leave yourself with space to drive into during the exit. Instead of braking at your regular braking point and catching aggressively under braking, try to brake at the same time the car in front does, and modulate your braking to prevent yourself from catching too quickly. Your braking zone and entry will be under the limit, but that allows you to calm down the entry, and focus on setting up a stronger exit, by leaving space to the car in front on entry, you won’t have to react to their throttle application, instead you can begin catching during the exit, and have a pace advantage during the next straight, letting you either easily draft past them on the straight, or at least be significantly alongside by the time you reach the next braking zone, giving yourself a better chance of making the pass.\n\nHopefully this will help some people out, and if you’re not sure whether you make this mistake, watch back a couple of your races and see if you find yourself catching cars within the corner and getting worse exits as a result. If this helped you out I'd really appreciate an upvote, and if there is anyone you know that would benefit from this article it would be great if you could share it with them, the wider the reach of these articles the easier it is for me to continue justifying to carving out the time to write them :)\n\nI'll throw in a couple of links to my courses/socials, but I'm happy to delete these if it goes against any kind of self promotion rules!\n\nCheers  \nTom  \nNoakesy Coaching\n\nPaid Courses/Coaching  \n[NoakesyCoaching.com](https://noakesycoaching.com/)\n\nFree Resources  \n[Discord](https://discord.gg/HE53t5yzah)  \n[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/@NoakesyCoaching)", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qrlif7", "subreddit": "iRacing", "author": "NoakesyCoaching", "score": 141, "comments": 15, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item"}, {"id": "946b1500c25e0b0d2beffecf57b14bcfbb4b8516", "source": "reddit", "title": "Muddy understeer at The Bend gt3", "body": "The title says it all pretty much\n\nI have a bit of a problem with handling the 296 GT3 fixed at the Bend this week.

Whatever the situation that got them there, the result is the same, cruising comfortably up to a car that is clearly slower than them, closing the gap by maybe even a second per lap until they are right on the bumper of the car in front, only to spend the next 3 laps unable to actually get past the car they caught so effortlessly. Naturally this is a super frustrating situation to be in, you feel how slow they’re going, you feel how slow you’re having to go to avoid hitting them in the mid corner, but you just can’t find the gap to overtake. They’re slow on the entries, to the point that you’re worried you’ll hit them under braking, but somehow they still pull a gap on you during corner exit, and now you have no way to make a move into the next corner. Always catching on corner entry, always losing out on corner exit, and never close enough in the braking zone for anything other than an extremely aggressive divebomb that 50% of the time ends in disaster. If you’ve encountered this frustration, then this article will help make sense of the problem, and give you the answer of how to make overtaking these drivers far more effortless. The fix can be boiled down to one sentence, but I want to spend this article breaking down the steps that you need to take to implement that sentence in practice.\n\n**Stop Catching During Corner Entry**\n\nCatching a driver too quickly during corner entry is the main cause of the scenario I described above. The sequence of events looks like this;\n\nYou’re behind the slower driver, but not close enough to make a move under braking\n\nThey brake early, and you capitalize by catching them under braking, wanting to keep the car on the limit and gain as much time to the car in front as you can.\n\nThey over-slow in the mid corner, and, caught out by this, you have to quickly overslow yourself to avoid running into the back of them.\n\nOn exit, they get on throttle when they normally would, but you’ve had to check up, slow down to avoid hitting them, and judge your throttle application based on when you see them already starting to accelerate.\n\nNaturally then, you’re always going to be disadvantaged on exit, as you’re having to react to when the car in front accelerates. This is the same reason why, at a high level, parking it just slightly on the apex is such an effective strategy to defend against a faster car. \n\nSo, what should you do instead? The answer is that you don’t want to catch the car in front within the corner, but instead calm down the corner, catching only a small amount during the entry, so that you leave yourself with space to drive into during the exit. Instead of braking at your regular braking point and catching aggressively under braking, try to brake at the same time the car in front does, and modulate your braking to prevent yourself from catching too quickly. Your braking zone and entry will be under the limit, but that allows you to calm down the entry, and focus on setting up a stronger exit, by leaving space to the car in front on entry, you won’t have to react to their throttle application, instead you can begin catching during the exit, and have a pace advantage during the next straight, letting you either easily draft past them on the straight, or at least be significantly alongside by the time you reach the next braking zone, giving yourself a better chance of making the pass.\n\nHopefully this will help some people out, and if you’re not sure whether you make this mistake, watch back a couple of your races and see if you find yourself catching cars within the corner and getting worse exits as a result. If this helped you out I'd really appreciate an upvote, and if there is anyone you know that would benefit from this article it would be great if you could share it with them, the wider the reach of these articles the easier it is for me to continue justifying to carving out the time to write them :)\n\nI'll throw in a couple of links to my courses/socials, but I'm happy to delete these if it goes against any kind of self promotion rules!\n\nCheers  \nTom  \nNoakesy Coaching\n\nPaid Courses/Coaching  \n[NoakesyCoaching.com](https://noakesycoaching.com/)\n\nFree Resources

I removed it from my rig, used pressurized air to dedust it and it started to work.\n\nAfter recalibration I noticed that I can't consistently brake or throttle. For all 3 of the pedals the story is the same - consistent force requirement up to around 50% and then the force amount required to increase input percentage decreases exponentially. I reach 50% of the input at pretty much the end of travel for pedal, last 50% of missing input is moved with like 2cm (less than an inch) of traveling. It feels like I barely move a muscle and throttle drops from 100% to around 50%, when before it would be like 95%.\n\n  \nThis wasn't the case before. During the initial setup of my rig i was able to adjust the force requirements perfectly and modulation of my inputs was more than possible.\n\nI tried messing with curve settings, but nothing seems to fit. At the moment all of them are just a straight line.\n\nI recalibrated my pedals tens of times, updated all software but issue persists.\n\nHas anyone encountered this issue and could help me? At first I thought my throttle pedal is broken, but since it's the same with all 3 I started to doubt it.\n\nMy setup: \n\n* Simsonn pro x ultra\n* Vam haptic feedback modules\n*  Simhub to manage haptic feedback\n* I did ground it just to try it (one end on a random screw on the control box itslef, other on a screw connecting my break pedal to the rig), but I'm almost certain that my power outlets are already grounded. My control box does not have any markings for grounding.

My boy has always been interested in cars and video games in relation to cars since a young age but I now have seen a cooler way to play which is the racing sim.What started as a simple idea quickly turned into comparing brands, setups, and what actually feels fun versus what just looks cool online. From what I’ve seen, names like Fanatec, Thrustmaster, and Logitech keep popping up when people talk about a solid racing simulator that balances realism and reliability. Fanatec seems to be the dream brand for serious racers, while Logitech and Thrustmaster feel more approachable for someone upgrading from a controller. What really matters to me is value. I want something immersive but not so complicated that it sits unused. Many parents recommend starting with a mid-range racing simulator setup and upgrading later if interest sticks. I’ve even noticed complete bundles on Alibaba that include wheels, pedals, and seats, which seems convenient if you’re starting from scratch.\n\nBeyond the hardware, the community aspect surprised me. A good racing simulator isn’t just a game, it’s leagues, mods, and people helping each other tweak settings at midnight. That’s actually part of the appeal as a gift.

I also want them close enough to clear the aluminum uprights for the wheel deck, but that brings them to about 28” eye to monitor distance.\n\nPics are appreciated too, thanks!", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qx81zi", "subreddit": "simracing", "author": "insanelyhugeman8", "score": 1, "comments": 2, "created_utc": 1770352648.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770362089, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "7eb777a83a53c0f8bdc42275f96ba68d472f1262", "source": "reddit", "title": "Really enjoying my first rig, Armoury Strix Cockpit", "body": "Just built my first sim rig and really enjoying it.

We started in at the beginning of this year as 2 friends upgraded from DFGT to Moza R3. Well league started great, but things took competitive trajectory really fast.

Racing in a league race. Final race of the winter season. Winner takes all from the top 5. I know I'm not the best in the league but can snag a win here or there. This race the leader was hands down the best. Already a hand on the trophy. I'm running in second a few seconds behind. Coming to the final stop of the race, I tag the wall just a bit and pick up a 12 seconds worth of damage. It's eating the tires so I pit, but the leader is already beating me to the punch. I figure it's over for the win but I'll spend a few extra seconds to fix a couple of seconds worth. I pull in, get the service but notice the leader hasn't left. Knowing that 3rd was still out there and only a few seconds off of me. I take off knowing this is the one shot I'll have to take the lead. I leave, pit stops cycle and I've maintained the gap to now second with the former leader now the last car on the lead lap. Come to find out after he had some issue on pit road coming to the box and had a hold for the penalty. After all that I was able to hang on to the lead and the championship. But not by being the fastest. Which brings me to the topic. Practice. Since day one I've always practiced getting on and off pit road. Doesn't matter the series or track. Oftentimes I'll come down and drive all the way through just to get back out and hit pit road again. Miata to Nascar, F4 to GTP.

Appealed and got it reduced to 3 days. Thank you iRacing for not being merciless.", "body": "I won a race the other night after getting what I thought was an incredible restart at the end of a Truck race to go from 6th to 1st. My incredible launch was accompanied by the front row absolutely blowing the restart and me getting around them all by the time I was off Turn 2. I was so stoked. Several people in my lobby congratulated me on what was the best restart they’ve ever seen.\n\nYou can imagine my surprise when 4 nights later, I cannot get into a race. Upon checking my email, I see I’ve gotten protested by the guy who was leading the race on the restart and my account had been suspended for 7 days. I was immediately pretty angry, especially considering from my POV I’d gotten a clean restart and the guy in his protest used words like “I was clearly the fastest car” and “I got my win robbed” even though I easily drove away from him after getting the lead. You could argue I jumped the restart, but I can also state I would’ve finished 3rd at best had he not spun his tires.\n\nI appealed this, stating my opinion that I hadn’t jumped the restart. It turns out that I didn’t truly understand how restarts work on iRacing. I was going faster than the leader at the time of green, so therefore it was decided I’d jumped the restart. He absolutely blew the restart, but it doesn’t matter in iRacing. The pace speed also doesn’t matter in iRacing. What matters is the leader’s speed. I did not know this.\n\nMy suspension meant I’d miss this week in the Winter iRacing Series, the season opener in the Whelen Modified Tour, AND the Daytona 500. The appellate board agreed a 7 day suspension was excessive and shortened it to three days, which at midnight I’ll already have served two days of. Considering I didn’t race yesterday, I wasn’t planning on racing today, and I’ll likely get home from work after midnight tomorrow, this was really a slap on the wrist.\n\nThe moral of the story is to always appeal even if you might be guilty. You might be guilty, but that doesn’t mean the appellate board will agree with your punishment.\n\nI also learned that not understanding the rules doesn’t really help you. I didn’t receive any coaching for this type of restart violation. I’d received coaching for a different type of restart violation in the past, but iRacing lumps everything together if in the same category. If you messed up in a category in the past, don’t mess up in a similar manner again. Of course, you might not even realize you’re breaking a rule. Doesn’t matter. When you run on the ragged edge and try to take any advantage you can, you run the risk of upsetting somebody and getting protested. Be very careful and be sure what you’re doing doesn’t operate in a gray area. Unlike real Motorsport, iRacing doesn’t really let gray areas slide.\n\nThe only thing I didn’t appreciate is that iRacing didn’t answer all of my questions about restart procedure, so there are still things I’m unsure about being legal or not. I am concerned I’m going to break a different type of restart rule in the future and get a long suspension.

I removed it from my rig, used pressurized air to dedust it and it started to work.\n\nAfter recalibration I noticed that I can't consistently brake or throttle. For all 3 of the pedals the story is the same - consistent force requirement up to around 50% and then the force amount required to increase input percentage decreases exponentially. I reach 50% of the input at pretty much the end of travel for pedal, last 50% of missing input is moved with like 2cm (less than an inch) of traveling. It feels like I barely move a muscle and throttle drops from 100% to around 50%, when before it would be like 95%.\n\n  \nThis wasn't the case before. During the initial setup of my rig i was able to adjust the force requirements perfectly and modulation of my inputs was more than possible.\n\nI tried messing with curve settings, but nothing seems to fit. At the moment all of them are just a straight line.\n\nI recalibrated my pedals tens of times, updated all software but issue persists.\n\nHas anyone encountered this issue and could help me? At first I thought my throttle pedal is broken, but since it's the same with all 3 I started to doubt it.\n\nMy setup: \n\n* Simsonn pro x ultra\n* Vam haptic feedback modules\n*  Simhub to manage haptic feedback\n* I did ground it just to try it (one end on a random screw on the control box itslef, other on a screw connecting my break pedal to the rig), but I'm almost certain that my power outlets are already grounded. My control box does not have any markings for grounding.

My boy has always been interested in cars and video games in relation to cars since a young age but I now have seen a cooler way to play which is the racing sim.What started as a simple idea quickly turned into comparing brands, setups, and what actually feels fun versus what just looks cool online. From what I’ve seen, names like Fanatec, Thrustmaster, and Logitech keep popping up when people talk about a solid racing simulator that balances realism and reliability. Fanatec seems to be the dream brand for serious racers, while Logitech and Thrustmaster feel more approachable for someone upgrading from a controller. What really matters to me is value. I want something immersive but not so complicated that it sits unused. Many parents recommend starting with a mid-range racing simulator setup and upgrading later if interest sticks. I’ve even noticed complete bundles on Alibaba that include wheels, pedals, and seats, which seems convenient if you’re starting from scratch.\n\nBeyond the hardware, the community aspect surprised me. A good racing simulator isn’t just a game, it’s leagues, mods, and people helping each other tweak settings at midnight. That’s actually part of the appeal as a gift.

We started in at the beginning of this year as 2 friends upgraded from DFGT to Moza R3. Well league started great, but things took competitive trajectory really fast. And for people that was doing targa florio or Nurburgring once per week, everyone have turned in to semi-hardcore trainers for next race. \n\nNow 7 people have Moza wheels bought only because of this league (R9 &amp; R12 mostly) after 4 races everyone is training everyday for next race, what pleases and worries me at the same time. Skill progress is astonishing, as a guy who was driving few races in iRacing weekly and was easyly in the lead in first two races I was actually sweeting in last one.\n\nIt’s fun and we are friends, but when we are on track we are serious (and friendly, you know saying that we are attacking) and if it comes to contacts we take them seriously, with penalties.

Racing in a league race. Final race of the winter season. Winner takes all from the top 5. I know I'm not the best in the league but can snag a win here or there. This race the leader was hands down the best. Already a hand on the trophy. I'm running in second a few seconds behind. Coming to the final stop of the race, I tag the wall just a bit and pick up a 12 seconds worth of damage. It's eating the tires so I pit, but the leader is already beating me to the punch. I figure it's over for the win but I'll spend a few extra seconds to fix a couple of seconds worth. I pull in, get the service but notice the leader hasn't left. Knowing that 3rd was still out there and only a few seconds off of me. I take off knowing this is the one shot I'll have to take the lead. I leave, pit stops cycle and I've maintained the gap to now second with the former leader now the last car on the lead lap. Come to find out after he had some issue on pit road coming to the box and had a hold for the penalty. After all that I was able to hang on to the lead and the championship. But not by being the fastest. Which brings me to the topic. Practice. Since day one I've always practiced getting on and off pit road. Doesn't matter the series or track. Oftentimes I'll come down and drive all the way through just to get back out and hit pit road again. Miata to Nascar, F4 to GTP. You never know when you might have to pit, and understanding pit road can help not turn a bad situation worse. I knew where and what to expect and it paid off.

Thank you iRacing for not being merciless.", "body": "I won a race the other night after getting what I thought was an incredible restart at the end of a Truck race to go from 6th to 1st. My incredible launch was accompanied by the front row absolutely blowing the restart and me getting around them all by the time I was off Turn 2. I was so stoked. Several people in my lobby congratulated me on what was the best restart they’ve ever seen.\n\nYou can imagine my surprise when 4 nights later, I cannot get into a race. Upon checking my email, I see I’ve gotten protested by the guy who was leading the race on the restart and my account had been suspended for 7 days. I was immediately pretty angry, especially considering from my POV I’d gotten a clean restart and the guy in his protest used words like “I was clearly the fastest car” and “I got my win robbed” even though I easily drove away from him after getting the lead. You could argue I jumped the restart, but I can also state I would’ve finished 3rd at best had he not spun his tires.\n\nI appealed this, stating my opinion that I hadn’t jumped the restart. It turns out that I didn’t truly understand how restarts work on iRacing. I was going faster than the leader at the time of green, so therefore it was decided I’d jumped the restart. He absolutely blew the restart, but it doesn’t matter in iRacing. The pace speed also doesn’t matter in iRacing. What matters is the leader’s speed. I did not know this.\n\nMy suspension meant I’d miss this week in the Winter iRacing Series, the season opener in the Whelen Modified Tour, AND the Daytona 500. The appellate board agreed a 7 day suspension was excessive and shortened it to three days, which at midnight I’ll already have served two days of. Considering I didn’t race yesterday, I wasn’t planning on racing today, and I’ll likely get home from work after midnight tomorrow, this was really a slap on the wrist.\n\nThe moral of the story is to always appeal even if you might be guilty. You might be guilty, but that doesn’t mean the appellate board will agree with your punishment.\n\nI also learned that not understanding the rules doesn’t really help you. I didn’t receive any coaching for this type of restart violation. I’d received coaching for a different type of restart violation in the past, but iRacing lumps everything together if in the same category. If you messed up in a category in the past, don’t mess up in a similar manner again. Of course, you might not even realize you’re breaking a rule. Doesn’t matter. When you run on the ragged edge and try to take any advantage you can, you run the risk of upsetting somebody and getting protested. Be very careful and be sure what you’re doing doesn’t operate in a gray area. Unlike real Motorsport, iRacing doesn’t really let gray areas slide.\n\nThe only thing I didn’t appreciate is that iRacing didn’t answer all of my questions about restart procedure, so there are still things I’m unsure about being legal or not. I am concerned I’m going to break a different type of restart rule in the future and get a long suspension.

I removed it from my rig, used pressurized air to dedust it and it started to work.\n\nAfter recalibration I noticed that I can't consistently brake or throttle. For all 3 of the pedals the story is the same - consistent force requirement up to around 50% and then the force amount required to increase input percentage decreases exponentially. I reach 50% of the input at pretty much the end of travel for pedal, last 50% of missing input is moved with like 2cm (less than an inch) of traveling. It feels like I barely move a muscle and throttle drops from 100% to around 50%, when before it would be like 95%.\n\n  \nThis wasn't the case before. During the initial setup of my rig i was able to adjust the force requirements perfectly and modulation of my inputs was more than possible.\n\nI tried messing with curve settings, but nothing seems to fit. At the moment all of them are just a straight line.\n\nI recalibrated my pedals tens of times, updated all software but issue persists.\n\nHas anyone encountered this issue and could help me? At first I thought my throttle pedal is broken, but since it's the same with all 3 I started to doubt it.\n\nMy setup: \n\n* Simsonn pro x ultra\n* Vam haptic feedback modules\n*  Simhub to manage haptic feedback\n* I did ground it just to try it (one end on a random screw on the control box itslef, other on a screw connecting my break pedal to the rig), but I'm almost certain that my power outlets are already grounded. My control box does not have any markings for grounding. Thats why i picked a random screw from my control box.\n\nThank you in advance for any help", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qxab15", "subreddit": "simracing", "author": "tavotevasbaryga", "score": 1, "comments": 0, "created_utc": 1770359766.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770362494, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "f8579c5f78d85df5ee5d8606734ccb8ea2ec6adf", "source": "reddit", "title": "Confused about NLR checkout lol", "body": "I went to go see what the cost was after shopping and stuff (found out I get free shipping, yay).

My boy has always been interested in cars and video games in relation to cars since a young age but I now have seen a cooler way to play which is the racing sim.What started as a simple idea quickly turned into comparing brands, setups, and what actually feels fun versus what just looks cool online. From what I’ve seen, names like Fanatec, Thrustmaster, and Logitech keep popping up when people talk about a solid racing simulator that balances realism and reliability. Fanatec seems to be the dream brand for serious racers, while Logitech and Thrustmaster feel more approachable for someone upgrading from a controller. What really matters to me is value. I want something immersive but not so complicated that it sits unused. Many parents recommend starting with a mid-range racing simulator setup and upgrading later if interest sticks. I’ve even noticed complete bundles on Alibaba that include wheels, pedals, and seats, which seems convenient if you’re starting from scratch.\n\nBeyond the hardware, the community aspect surprised me. A good racing simulator isn’t just a game, it’s leagues, mods, and people helping each other tweak settings at midnight. That’s actually part of the appeal as a gift.

We started in at the beginning of this year as 2 friends upgraded from DFGT to Moza R3. Well league started great, but things took competitive trajectory really fast. And for people that was doing targa florio or Nurburgring once per week, everyone have turned in to semi-hardcore trainers for next race. \n\nNow 7 people have Moza wheels bought only because of this league (R9 &amp; R12 mostly) after 4 races everyone is training everyday for next race, what pleases and worries me at the same time.

Racing in a league race. Final race of the winter season. Winner takes all from the top 5. I know I'm not the best in the league but can snag a win here or there. This race the leader was hands down the best. Already a hand on the trophy. I'm running in second a few seconds behind. Coming to the final stop of the race, I tag the wall just a bit and pick up a 12 seconds worth of damage. It's eating the tires so I pit, but the leader is already beating me to the punch. I figure it's over for the win but I'll spend a few extra seconds to fix a couple of seconds worth. I pull in, get the service but notice the leader hasn't left. Knowing that 3rd was still out there and only a few seconds off of me. I take off knowing this is the one shot I'll have to take the lead. I leave, pit stops cycle and I've maintained the gap to now second with the former leader now the last car on the lead lap. Come to find out after he had some issue on pit road coming to the box and had a hold for the penalty. After all that I was able to hang on to the lead and the championship. But not by being the fastest. Which brings me to the topic. Practice. Since day one I've always practiced getting on and off pit road. Doesn't matter the series or track. Oftentimes I'll come down and drive all the way through just to get back out and hit pit road again. Miata to Nascar, F4 to GTP. You never know when you might have to pit, and understanding pit road can help not turn a bad situation worse. I knew where and what to expect and it paid off. Practicing the lap time is one thing, but there are many other aspects to racing that also should garner some practice.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qx866b", "subreddit": "iRacing", "author": "Novawolf125", "score": 2, "comments": 1, "created_utc": 1770352999.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770362498, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "404fc04ed0162e4b83d72872b17df2152a4538f1", "source": "reddit", "title": "Any tips for special awareness", "body": "Hi I am looking for some help with spacial awareness.

I felt like I initially gave enough space for the car to go by however as we reach the 2nd part I felt like I had no room to go and the LMP2 tried taking a line thinking I wasn't present. Counterpoint, I probably should've gone wider in the first chicane to give more clearer space and hindsight should've just gone for the run off going into the 2nd corner.

I removed it from my rig, used pressurized air to dedust it and it started to work.\n\nAfter recalibration I noticed that I can't consistently brake or throttle. For all 3 of the pedals the story is the same - consistent force requirement up to around 50% and then the force amount required to increase input percentage decreases exponentially. I reach 50% of the input at pretty much the end of travel for pedal, last 50% of missing input is moved with like 2cm (less than an inch) of traveling. It feels like I barely move a muscle and throttle drops from 100% to around 50%, when before it would be like 95%.\n\n  \nThis wasn't the case before. During the initial setup of my rig i was able to adjust the force requirements perfectly and modulation of my inputs was more than possible.\n\nI tried messing with curve settings, but nothing seems to fit. At the moment all of them are just a straight line.\n\nI recalibrated my pedals tens of times, updated all software but issue persists.\n\nHas anyone encountered this issue and could help me? At first I thought my throttle pedal is broken, but since it's the same with all 3 I started to doubt it.\n\nMy setup: \n\n* Simsonn pro x ultra\n* Vam haptic feedback modules\n*  Simhub to manage haptic feedback\n* I did ground it just to try it (one end on a random screw on the control box itslef, other on a screw connecting my break pedal to the rig), but I'm almost certain that my power outlets are already grounded. My control box does not have any markings for grounding. Thats why i picked a random screw from my control box.\n\nThank you in advance for any help", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qxab15", "subreddit": "simracing", "author": "tavotevasbaryga", "score": 1, "comments": 0, "created_utc": 1770359766.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770362814, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "dd5843ee2988593c629549c4304ced092b1804a8", "source": "reddit", "title": "Confused about NLR checkout lol", "body": "I went to go see what the cost was after shopping and stuff (found out I get free shipping, yay).

My boy has always been interested in cars and video games in relation to cars since a young age but I now have seen a cooler way to play which is the racing sim.What started as a simple idea quickly turned into comparing brands, setups, and what actually feels fun versus what just looks cool online. From what I’ve seen, names like Fanatec, Thrustmaster, and Logitech keep popping up when people talk about a solid racing simulator that balances realism and reliability. Fanatec seems to be the dream brand for serious racers, while Logitech and Thrustmaster feel more approachable for someone upgrading from a controller. What really matters to me is value. I want something immersive but not so complicated that it sits unused. Many parents recommend starting with a mid-range racing simulator setup and upgrading later if interest sticks. I’ve even noticed complete bundles on Alibaba that include wheels, pedals, and seats, which seems convenient if you’re starting from scratch.\n\nBeyond the hardware, the community aspect surprised me. A good racing simulator isn’t just a game, it’s leagues, mods, and people helping each other tweak settings at midnight. That’s actually part of the appeal as a gift.

We started in at the beginning of this year as 2 friends upgraded from DFGT to Moza R3. Well league started great, but things took competitive trajectory really fast.

Racing in a league race. Final race of the winter season. Winner takes all from the top 5. I know I'm not the best in the league but can snag a win here or there. This race the leader was hands down the best. Already a hand on the trophy. I'm running in second a few seconds behind. Coming to the final stop of the race, I tag the wall just a bit and pick up a 12 seconds worth of damage. It's eating the tires so I pit, but the leader is already beating me to the punch. I figure it's over for the win but I'll spend a few extra seconds to fix a couple of seconds worth. I pull in, get the service but notice the leader hasn't left. Knowing that 3rd was still out there and only a few seconds off of me. I take off knowing this is the one shot I'll have to take the lead. I leave, pit stops cycle and I've maintained the gap to now second with the former leader now the last car on the lead lap. Come to find out after he had some issue on pit road coming to the box and had a hold for the penalty. After all that I was able to hang on to the lead and the championship. But not by being the fastest. Which brings me to the topic. Practice. Since day one I've always practiced getting on and off pit road. Doesn't matter the series or track. Oftentimes I'll come down and drive all the way through just to get back out and hit pit road again. Miata to Nascar, F4 to GTP. You never know when you might have to pit, and understanding pit road can help not turn a bad situation worse. I knew where and what to expect and it paid off.

So I kinda have it Jerry rigged on there at the moment. The pedals are held on with one bolt in the back of each pedal and the screw holes in the wheel base dont line up so im using the clamp which barely fits on there.

I have a C license and a 3.47 safety rating. I am sitting around 1900 IR. I race Porsche Cup a lot, obviously that one is just asking to be massacred. I also mess around in the Toyota GR86. I was just doing a race in production car challenge, and had an incident where I was running in 3rd place, fighting with fourth place, the last place BMW went off track at turn 1 on summit and we passed him. The guy I was battling was side by side with me going into turn 2 which is already an awkward move to pull off, but I wasn’t worried because we had been respectfully battling for a couple laps now. The BMW then gets the bright idea to try and overtake going 3 wide into turn 2. He collected both of us and I got a meatball out of it. I should have clipped it. I’m just wondering if there is any series where you notice people tend to care about survival a bit more or where people just handle their cars better overall.

This makes you a \"ghost car\" which allows you to go out on the track during the race without affecting the race itself. You don't have to worry about wrecking other cars, but you can still get the feel of being part of an official race instead of just doing practice or time trial sessions. Other drivers won't see you or be able to make contact with you.\n\nIt's not going to 100% replicate an actual race because you are a ghost and have no physical interaction with the other cars. But you can treat it like a real race - you can learn the track while having other cars around you to learn from, you can work on your racecraft along other live drivers, etc. Plus, you still get the effects of normal race physics, so you'll still experience drafting, evolving track conditions, etc. just as if you were actually in the race. \n\nThe best part? It functions like a test session, which means it doesn't affect your iR or your safety rating. \n\nThere's an [article all about it](https://support.iracing.com/support/solutions/articles/31000133497-ghost-racing) on the iRacing website too for total info, if you want to learn more. All you have to do is go to an official series, go to \"Spectate Live Sessions\" and click the Start Spectating button, then look for an official race that's happening and join as a spectator!\n\nThis is something I've been doing since I've started with iRacing and I've found it to be one of the most helpful ways to not just learn a new track, but to learn how to race a new track, too. For all you drivers out there that are having issues with improvement or consistency or general confidence behind the wheel, I highly recommend giving it a try!", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0bupn", "subreddit": "iRacing", "author": "oldspicecanyon", "score": 52, "comments": 29, "created_utc": 1770661034.0, "mode": "hot", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770698894, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "5d11ea517a9934008329f6c2544d777a1d6c653d", "source": "reddit", "title": "Good luck to all of the drivers starting their journey through the 38 week NASCAR season today!", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r08mx2", "subreddit": "iRacing", "author": "JayRGM", "score": 70, "comments": 20, "created_utc": 1770654187.0, "mode": "hot", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770698894, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "bf11207bd35de3240c906d7717627f62c21feb5d", "source": "reddit", "title": "One year of Sim Racing!", "body": "So addicted and hungry to continue improving.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0dc5g", "subreddit": "iRacing", "author": "derek_012", "score": 33, "comments": 11, "created_utc": 1770664189.0, "mode": "hot", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770698894, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "909b71655280ee724517e72dac0a92ac833ee1df", "source": "reddit", "title": "Silly Question", "body": "Is there any kind of way to play the original 2008 version of iracing somehow?

I tried racing yesterday with my 34 inch ultrawide and put it as close to my face as possible for max FOV and after 20/30 minutes I got used to the 3D lack of depth and felt quite immersed. The fact that I could see my real hands was quite nice too.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is the lack of 3d depth worth the trade off for a sim build like this if you had the space? I guess another trade off is you kind of have to build it for one type of car.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r1lpa1", "subreddit": "simracing", "author": "skytrainlotad", "score": 2, "comments": 3, "created_utc": 1770778685.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770782876, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "ac63f737ca794b267567b676415c332c9fe6b811", "source": "reddit", "title": "TR Fibreglass GT Seat lower back pain", "body": "I got a new setup from Trak Racer, the tr80s to be exact, with this seat, and I either get some lower back pain, or it just goes numb.

Last couple of laps had a good back and forth with this driver, he was patient and did not dive bomb when he could have, gave me space and I did what I could to repay that when it was obvious he was going to pass. We were very close (not close enough, but that's racing) coming to the line. We both continued on through T1 and approaching T2 I pulled over into the Pit Lane exit and stopped. He rear ended me. It was a glancing blow, but from my perspective it looked like he had swerved into me intentionally. He hadn't.

Looking back at the replay, it looks like the 55 car might have even been on a trajectory to have the right side of the car on the grass.
