But this is where *context* matters:\n\n1. **The Celtics were a completely different tier of defensive team from the Spurs**.\n\nYes, RTS/relative efficiency “adjusts” for opponent defense, but it does so in a basically linear way, and that assumption is most reliable in normal matchups. It treats *playing a -4 defense* vs *playing a -9 defense* as mostly the same thing, just more of it. In outlier situations, I don't think it's a hot take to say that assumption might be challenged. A historically great defense doesn’t just shave a few points off league-average shot quality, it can change the entire shot distribution, force turnovers instead of just contested attempts, and load the primary action if the supporting cast can't punish help.  That’s what the 2008 Celtics series became: a defense that’s elite everywhere (rim, help, rotations, physicality) *plus* a matchup context (weak spacing / weak secondary creation) that lets them sell out at a level most “top defenses” simply can’t. So “-4 vs -9” isn’t just a 5-point difference on paper. It's a different category of constraint on what a heliocentric offense can even run.\n\n2) **Polar opposite Spacing and offensive cast differences:**\n\nThe 5 most played Heat players for LeBron lineups were : Wade, Bosh, Chalmers, Ray Allen, and Mike Miller, in order. According to advanced metric **Estimated Plus Minus**, here's where each of them graded out offensively that year:\n\n\\- Wade: +2.4 (*96th percentile)*\n\n*-* Bosh: +1.4 (*90th percentile)*\n\n*-* Chalmers: +1.3 (*89th percentile)*\n\n*-* Allen: +.7 (*79th percentile)*\n\n*-* Miller: +1.3 (*88th percentile)*\n\nThe Heat quickly abandoned double big lineups with Haslem, which were the norm in that era, for highly spaced ones, slanting offensively heavily. Of course it helped that Bosh was a well above average spacer at the 5 while also being good defensively, a rare skillset.\n\n\\---\n\nMeanwhile for the Cavs: Delonte West, Szczerbiak, Ilgauskas, Wallace, Joe Smith. Here's where each of them graded out offensively that year:\n\n\\- West: -1.9 (*35th percentile)*\n\n*-* Szczerbiak: -.2 (*66th percentile*)\n\n\\- Ilgauskas: +0, (*69th percentile)*\n\n*-* Wallace: -1.9 *(34th percentile)*\n\n*-* Smith: -.5 (*60th percentile)*\n\nThe Cavs took the opposite approach. Ben Wallace was acquired by the Cavs midway through the season in 2008. The Cavs only played 500 minutes the whole regular season with LeBron and Ben Wallace on the court, and LeBron's scoring numbers and the Cavs offense had suffered in those minutes, which was unsurprising given Wallace's glaring offensive issues. But the defense was strong. So the Cavs leaned into the defense against the Celtics.\n\nBottom line: The Cavs graded out as one of the worst offensive casts in the entire league, the Heat graded out as one of the best.\n\n\\---------------------\n\n# Narrative:\n\n**2013 LeBron:**\n\nPeople will point to Wade's underperformance in those finals, and the Spurs aggressively helping off of him, to contextualize what is from a production perspective an underperformance from a GOAT candidate at the perceived peak of his powers. Essentially:\n\n\"*While LeBron's production doesn't seem like an all time series, there are contextual factors that are being overlooked here, primarily LeBron not getting a lot of help from his co-stars, and the Spurs taking advantage of that to limit his scoring'*\n\nAdditionally, LeBron's Game 6 + Game 7 performances are indexed upon, to demonstrate that at the end of the day, there isn't really a defensive strategy that can truly limit his impact. In those final 2 games, he averaged: **39 pts, 8.5 assists per 100 on +7 RTS**, capping it off with a **37 point Game 7.**\n\nThe Spurs 'dared LeBron to shoot'. LeBron showed Pops that ultimately this cannot work, and in his own words: *\" I just told myself, don't abandon what you’ve done all year. Don’t abandon now because they’re going under. Don’t force the paint. If it’s there, take it. If not, take the jumper\".*\n\nA fitting victory of self belief for a LeBron who had now clearly established himself as one of the best players ever.\n\n**2008 LeBron:**\n\nAt the end of the day, LeBron was one of the premier superstars in the league. But he had clear deficits in his game that a great defensive team could expose, and his jumpshot was still very shakey, and a big weakness.\n\nIt may be true that the Celtics were a great defensive team, but might not have been quite as good as their regular season numbers suggested, as they went 7 games against Atlanta (*The Celtics had a +14 net rating that series, but apparently this is not as relevant as them going 7*).\n\nIt's also true that the Celtics held an MVP Kobe Bryant who had one of the best offensive casts in the league, *to below LeBron level scoring volume and neutral efficiency* in the finals, but perhaps this was an off series from Kobe. Rather than a signal that the Celtics had the capability of shutting off the water of superstars even in good offensive situations.\n\nNow.. LeBron did have a great game 6+7: **48 pts, 7.5 assists per 100 on +6.5 RTS,** and a **45 point Game 7**. But, it doesn't quite hit has hard, and this was probably more upward shooting variance than something repeatable *(In actuality, LeBron still shot sub 30% from 3 and sub 40% from midrang*e.  *His success came from getting to the rim at an absurd rate and being rewarded by free throws, which seems like some of the least 'variance' stuff imaginable. Just great process)*\n\n# What do I think:\n\nI think 2008 LeBron's ECSF was genuinely one of his more impressive playoff series of his career. It was one of the most outlier David vs. Goliath, superstar with poor  offensive cast going up against a great defensive team hell bent on stopping him, series in NBA history.\n\nIn that environment there isn’t a clean baseline for “what he’s supposed to look like,”\n\nHis jumper was extremely off early, and it never turned into some hot-streak outlier. But the process was fantastic, and he stayed committed to the highest-value outcome available: **Rim pressure, foul generation,** and he essentially proved that even Boston coverage couldn’t fully keep him off the paint or off the line. In fact, what he could put even more pressure, and draw even more fouls than in the regular season, with seemingly this extra gear he could tap into (*59 % FT Rate that series)*\n\nAnd it was a true 2 way performance. He was really damn good defensively and the anchor of the Cavs' defense, and consistently made plays that very few players in the league could make with his court coverage and motor.\n\nOverall, the reason this series hits harder for me than 2013 is that the setup was so hilariously broken in 2008. Miami could put four credible offensive players around LeBron. Cleveland could barely even put 1. In that exact context, even a -10 RTS collapse from most stars wouldn’t be surprising, you’d just shrug and say “there’s nowhere to go.”", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qm2gt2", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Aggressive_Bed6012", "score": 69, "comments": 65, "created_utc": 1769297217.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770225180, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "377ad52cc2413cd85dac5a906f1a82097fc2ad6b", "source": "reddit", "title": "Why Shaq's PPG so low despite being so dominant?", "body": "I remember shaq being so dominant but am surprised that his PPG didn't get higher than 30 PPG average in a season.\n\nI figured it must be because he has very capable second/co-first scorer (penny then kobe) that he doesn't need to score so much.\n\nBut then again, some seasons that are without peak kobe or penny, he should have scored much higher.\n\nSo why do you think his PPG isn't higher like Jordan's 30+?\n\nMy reasoning are these. \n\n1. average points per game is historically lowest during his career\n\n2. very good 2nd scorer that takes points away from him\n\n  \ndo you all agree? any other reasons?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qkhs4l", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "thisnaenae", "score": 159, "comments": 222, "created_utc": 1769144512.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770225180, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "ee12aa1cd350945bfa536f66ad26d9dfdf77558f", "source": "reddit", "title": "What do you think are the final moves that will happen today and tomorrow?", "body": "I know there are like a million threads/discussions on this at this point, but I am curious to know what everyone thinks the next steps are and if there are any at all.

Is Cleveland just another example of teams putting too much weight on the current season production and not taking into account the variance in player production. \n\nClearly Harden has had a much better season to this date, but both Harden and Garland are pretty high variance players. Harden has been on a high and Garland has been low, but it really won't be that surprising to me if both players put up very similar production the rest of the year or if Garland is better in the second half of the season than Harden. \n\nHarden is also clearly at his best when he gets to be the first option. He seems to be the type of player that basically puts up the same efficiency regardless of how many shots he's taking. Honestly he might even be a player, who's efficiency goes up the more shots they take. I expect him to look worse playing second fiddle in Cleveland then he did as a first option for LAC.\n\nOverall this just seems really short-sighted by Cleveland. Harden is at the age where his production is likely to fall off a cliff at some point in the near future. That could be the second half of this season, more likely next season, almost guaranteed that his production falls off a cliff two seasons from now. Garland is 26, is having a very rough year, but just put up solid numbers last year and is likely to bounce back to form. maybe there are some medical issues with Garland that teams know about that I don't, that make this trade make more sense.\n\nMaybe Cleveland is a little bit closer to competing this year, but the long-term future just got a lot more bleak in my opinion. \n\nEdit: \n\nA lot of people seem to doubt that Garland was ever really that valuable of a player. Putting another reddit post down below that talks about Garlands value at his best.

His teams were consistently top-heavy and lacking depth, which is the easiest way to catch criticism as a great #2 (like Blake) makes it much harder to attribute a playoff loss to “lack of help” than a poorly-constructed team. They also got injured at inopportune times, and the eventual conference winner pretty much always much better/deeper.\n\nLet’s go year-by-year and look who he lost to/the general West playoff landscape, and see if he could’ve been reasonably expected to win:\n\n‘08 Spurs - core of Duncan/Parker/Ginobili/Bowen/Finley. Chose ‘08 to not be accused of cherry-picking as they’re actually somewhat comparable here — Fin and Bowen were old, Barry and Horry were beyond washed. Nonetheless, CP3 still faced a supporting cast deficit and appropriately lost narrowly.\n\n‘09 Nuggets - Melo/still-prime Billups/Nene/Smith/Martin/Birdman/Kleiza had them clearly out-gunned, especially with Chandler’s injury.\n\n‘11 Lakers - laughable disparity. A rotation of Paul/Ariza/Belinelli/Okafor/Landry/Jack wasn’t gonna beat even a creaky Lakers team consisting of Kobe/Odom/Gasol/MWP/Fisher.\n\n‘12 Spurs - again just a ridiculous first round match-up. Paul-Griffin-Butler-Foye-young DAJ-young Bledsoe against Duncan/Parker/Ginobili/Green/Neal/Zygote Kawhi/Diaw/Splitter. If they beat them they’d have to face a much better Thunder team.\n\n‘13 Grizzlies - Paul/injured Blake/Barnes/Crawford/Bledsoe/pre-prime DAJ against Randolph/Conley/Gasol/Allen/Bayless/Prince and co. Not a total mismatch but we’re talking about an injured Clippers facing a 56 win team in the first round.\n\n‘14 Thunder - not a mismatch, Durant had a slightly better supporting cast, but still a roster deficit. The Spurs, of course, had a much deeper team.\n\n‘15 Rockets - not a mismatch, but Paul was injured. They lose in 7. They are likely not beating the Warriors even at full strength, and they beat a 55 win, defending champ Spurs team in the first round.\n\n‘16 Blazers - not a mismatch, CP3 has some culpability here, though again he was injured. Nonetheless, even if they won, they had the 73 win Warriors team awaiting them.\n\n‘17 Jazz - here Griffin was injured. Paul played very well but again drew a 50+ win team in the first round and again would’ve had to beat one of the best teams ever to even make the final.\n\nIn sum: even in early-round settings he usually faced a supporting cast deficit, with the team they lost to not even necessarily being the strongest team on offer, while having extremely poor injury luck in a historically stacked/lopsided conference.\n\nThere was never a year where they, even at full health, would’ve had a better supporting cast than the eventual conference winner. There was one when they were somewhat close (‘14), but still no cigar.\n\nNote: I am not a Paul fan, find him insufferable, and don’t regard him as a playoff riser by any means. But it sure does seem that, once you examine things year-by-year, it becomes difficult to pin their lack of playoff success squarely on his limitations as a #1 option. You put those same teams out East and it likely completely changes how the average fan sees him.

What about the OKC Thunder when it comes to Giannis? The thought of that had already been floating in my mind. And I'd love to hear everyone's opinions.\n\n**Is it time for Sam Presti to officially drop the hammer and go all-in for Giannis?**\n\nWe've been hearing the same story for the past couple of weeks. There are 4 teams that are routinely mentioned a ton and could \"really use\" Giannis and should try to trade for him. Those teams are GSW, MIN, MIA and NYK.\n\nBut let's be honest.\n\nNYK - Does MIL really want KAT, an 11-year vet who (in my opinion) has been steadily declining over the past few years and has arguably been one of the most injury-prone players since the 2019 season? Yes there's a possibility of someone like Bridges being included too, but is that what MIL envisions for their future? A lineup of Bridges, KAT and Myles Turner? Do they envision that being their team for the next 2-4 years? A kind of 41-41 or 44-38 team? Or do they want a FRESH restart, with young guys and top picks?\n\nMIN - I cannot envision a world where the Timberwolves offer enough to get Giannis. They have no draft capital, which means they'd literally have to give up the house for him. That means giving up Jaden McDaniels, Naz Reid, Julius Randle and probably Rob Dillingham, and likely their 2026 Pick. Maybe that's enough, but that creates a similar situation as the Knicks. Does MIL want to become a 40-44 win team that just kind of \"hangs around\" in the 8-10th seeds, or do they want to start completely fresh?\n\nMIA - Again, yet another situation where it just feels like a meh kind of offer. Tyler Herro, sure he can score, but he's a huge liability on defense. Ware is nice. Jaquez Jr is a solid, if not unspectacular addition. But again, feels like a team that would go 35, maybe 40 wins. Herro is also super injury prone.\n\nGSW - They probably have the best shot out of the 4 teams that are heavily mentioned. Kuminga matches the \"young talent that can grow\" that MIL might want...Moody is interesting as a throw-in. Lets be honest though, Jimmy isn't going to stay there. He's old now, and will be coming off an ACL tear. Brandon Pod is another meh addition to me, not someone you build around. The picks are nice, and probably what sets them apart from the other teams...albeit they are unprotected.\n\n**In come the Thunder. The team that \"doesn't need him at all\"...but has the most to offer to get him.**\n\nI believe whole-heartedly that this is the time for Sam Presti to go all-in. SGA is still young and just started the beginning of his prime. And an addition of someone like Giannis would honestly be the second coming of Shaq and Kobe in my opinion. Obviously different players and different styles, but having SGA and Giannis on the same team feels almost like a cheat code. And I believe that there are multiple ways for them to make this splash happen.\n\n* **Option 1**: OKC offers Ajay Mitchell, Aaron Wiggins, and (3) 1st Round Picks. I fully believe that Ajay Mitchell is a star in the making, and could very easily be a 20-5-6 guy if he were ever a starting job with 34 MPG. Wiggins as well has excelled when given the opportunity. Both are young up-and-coming players, and I believe are players you can build around. Or at minimum, are players you can use to surround whoever your next \"star\" is. The 3 First Round Picks as well give the Bucks the opportunity for that \"big reset\" as well.\n* **Option 2**: Could OKC do something even crazier, and give up Jalen Williams? Now I love me some Jalen Williams, but the honest-to-god truth is that J-Dub is *always* injured. Aside from his rookie season, feels like he's always battling some kind of injury or coming in with a GTD tag for some kind of nagging injury. He missed 11 games in 2024. He missed 13 games in 2025. He's already missed 20+ games this season and we're only at the 48-game mark. Never a good sign when someone this young (24 years old) is already missing this many games early in their career. Could the front office get frisky and dangerous....and actually offer up a package of Jalen Williams, along with someone like Wiggins and say (2) 1st Round Picks? It's definitely a crazier take, but if I'm the front office, I'm looking at every avenue.\n\nFor me, this is an easy win for the OKC Thunder. You secure what will essentially be the future of your franchise. Pairing Giannis with SGA for what would likely be at least the next  5-8 years, and having a legit shot at not one, not two, but multiple championship runs.\n\n**SGA, Lu Dort, Jalen Williams, Giannis, and Chet** as your starting five.\n\nI-Hart, Caruso, Cason Wallace, Jaylin Williams and Isaiah Joe are your 5 off the bench.\n\nMake this make sense to me on how this scenario isn't going through Presti's mind.\n\nI'd love to hear the communities thoughts.\n\n**/TLDR** \\- Thunder could be looking like the next dynasty if they go in for Giannis.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qrwz0w", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "anasazigb", "score": 74, "comments": 68, "created_utc": 1769848234.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770225459, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "467b249ec5ae843ce2e073998fa27d42fc7546ec", "source": "reddit", "title": "What are your top 5 REALISTC destinations for Lebron that MAXIMIZES championship possibility but DOESN'T feel like ring chasing or team stacking?", "body": "A few assumptions - I assume that Lebron's age and clout and media circus will dissuade many teams from making a large financial commitment. I believe any contender that signs him will demand a discount well below a max contract. Any team capable of giving him a max contract is probably not a serious contender anyway\n\nRealistic -  the team wants Lebron and Lebron wants them too. Realistic teams are probably teams that don't feel like ring chasing. Realistic teams are clean skillset fits, money is reasonable, and have a decent/solid/ok chance at winning a title are more realistic\n\n1. Skillset fit - At this point Lebron is no longer a first option and his rim pressuring is also not reliable anymore. He's solidly a 2nd or third option on offense. What he still has in spades is passing, defensive playcalling, and offball cutting/spot up. A team which duplicates Lebron's skills probably won't want him because they won't benefit much from him.\n2. Money - IMO any team that wants to maximize Lebron's championship value, will have to offer him only about half the max salary. Lebron is simply not consistent enough, nor does he provide enough regular season value, especially due to missed games due to injury. Any team should basically only expect to benefit from him mostly in the playoffs. Relying in him during the regular season is expecting too much and a waste of his limited playing time\n3. Ring Chasing/Narrative - joining the defending champs (OKC), historic rivals (DEN, BOS, SAS) feels cheap, and doesn't feel like adding a lot to his legacy. Joining some random team (ORL, DET) without some story justification will look heavily like ring chasing or money chasing, depending on the circumstances, or feel pointless.\n\nThe only historic rival that kinda feels ok is GSW, only because Curry is the only guy in his era that matches Lebron in ring count and legacy points. Any ring that Lebron wins also gives Curry a ring, so it kinda cancels out and doesn't really feel like ring chasing, but provides story novelty for the fans.\n\nTo me best fits outside of LAL are CLE (story and skillset) and NYK (skillset).

In his sophomore season in 2020–21, he was 20 years old to start the season. He played 61 out of 72 possible games and averaged 27/7.2/3.7 on 64.9% TS% in 33.2 minutes per game.\n\nHere is how he compared to the other high-efficiency, high-volume scorers in the league that season:\n\n\\&gt; Stephen Curry: 32 PPG on 65.5 TS% in 62 games (MVP-3)\n\n\\&gt; Zion Williamson: 27 PPG on 64.9 TS% in 61 games\n\n\\&gt; Nikola Jokić: 26.4 PPG on 64.7 TS% in 72 games (MVP-1)\n\n\\&gt; Joel Embiid: 28.5 PPG on 63.6 TS% in 51 games (MVP-2)\n\n\\&gt; Giannis Antetokounmpo: 28.1 PPG on 63.3 TS% in 61 games (MVP-4)\n\nBasically, Stephen Curry was the only player that season who scored significantly more points than Zion at a similar (negligibly higher) efficiency. The only four players in Zion’s vicinity were ranked 1st through 4th in MVP voting. I am not claiming he was a better player than the others listed that season — only that what he did in terms of high volume combined with efficiency was historically extraordinary for a 20-year-old sophomore scorer. Zion did not crack even an All-NBA Third Team that season.\n\nIf we compare this to other scoring seasons by players who were 20 years old to start the season, there are only three other examples of a player scoring 25+ PPG. For the sake of fairness, if you adjust all four seasons to 2026 league-average TS% (58%) and standardize pace to 75 possessions, you get:\n\n\\&gt; Zion Williamson ’21: 29.3 PP75 on 65.8 TS%, 113.5 Adjusted TS%\n\n\\&gt; Kevin Durant ’09: 26.6 PP75 on 61.6 TS%, 106.1 Adjusted TS%\n\n\\&gt; LeBron James ’05: 28.2 PP75 on 60.7 TS%, 104.7 Adjusted TS%\n\n\\&gt; Luka Dončić ’20: 31.9 PP75 on 59.9 TS%, 103.4 Adjusted TS%\n\nAgain, the difference in efficiency is striking, and those three players are very likely among the top 10 greatest offensive players of all time.\n\nThese are the only two seasons this decade in which players averaged both more adjusted points per 75 and a higher adjusted TS% than Zion Williamson in 2021 (29.3 PP75 on 65.8 TS%, 113.5 ATS%):\n\n\\&gt; 2020–21 Stephen Curry: 32.4 PP75 on 66.4 TS%, 114.5 ATS%\n\n\\&gt; 2021–22 Nikola Jokić: 30.5 PP75 on 67.7 TS%, 116.8 ATS%\n\nEven if you relax the requirement to include approximate cases or extremes in either volume or efficiency, the only three additional seasons you could reasonably add are:\n\n\\&gt; Jokić ’23 (much higher efficiency at much lower volume)\n\n\\&gt; Embiid ’23 (much higher volume at slightly lower efficiency)\n\n\\&gt; Jokić ’25 (slightly lower volume at slightly higher efficiency)\n\n⸻\n\nFinally, here’s a list of all players with 65+ games played (or on pace in a shortened season), averaging 25+ PPG on 110+ adjusted TS% in the last 10 years (Zion, as discussed, had 27 PPG on 113.5+ TS% so the efficiency standards are significantly lower than Zion’s season):\n\n1. SGA ’25 (MVP)\n\n2. Jokić ’25 (MVP-2)\n\n3. Giannis ’24 (MVP-4)\n\n4. Jokić ’24 (MVP)\n\n5. Jokić ’23 (MVP-2)\n\n6. Embiid ’23 (MVP)\n\n7. Jokić ’22 (MVP)\n\n8. Curry ’21 (MVP-3)\n\n9. Giannis ’21 (MVP-4)\n\n10. Jokić ’21 (MVP-1)\n\n11. Harden ’20 (MVP-1)\n\n12. Lillard ’20 (All-NBA Second Team)\n\n13. Giannis ’19 (MVP-1)\n\n14. Curry ’19 (MVP-5)\n\n15. Harden ’19 (MVP-2)\n\n16. Durant ’19 (All-NBA Second Team)\n\n17. Durant ’18 (All-NBA First Team)\n\n18. LeBron ’18 (MVP-2)\n\n19. Harden ’18 (MVP-1)\n\n20. Anthony Davis ’18 (MVP-3)\n\n21. Isaiah Thomas ’17 (MVP-5)\n\n22. Curry ’17 (All-NBA Second Team)\n\n23. Harden ’17 (MVP-2)\n\n24. LeBron ’17 (MVP-4)\n\nThat’s 20/25 top MVP finishes and out of the other 4, 3 deserved it but were shafted due to them belonging to KD and Steph on the warriors, 1 Lillard second team All-NBA season and 1 Zion season without all-league accolades. \n\nI understand that Zion injured himself towards the end of the season but that was after playing 85% of the season. His team was also 11th that season. However, apparently those considerations only apply if you don’t have a HOF career before the season. \n\nFor example, Lillard in ‘23 played only 70% of the season (58 games) AND injured himself at the end of the season AND was on the 13th seed. Despite a much worse triple whammy, he still made All-NBA. Luka (who is my favourite player) got the benefit of the doubt in ‘23 (deservedly) to make the friggin first team on the 11th seed after missing more games. LeBron in the same season as Zion played a mere 45 games in ‘21 and made second team All NBA on a 7th seed team in large part due to him being LeBron James and his momentum from winning FMVP the previous year. \n\nAnyway, \n\n1. Do you think Zion’s season is underrated? \n\n2. Do you think he deserved a slot on the second or third team? \n\n3. Do you think the voters feeling his production was unsustainable and the timing of his injury played a part in him not getting all-league accolades?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qr5u4f", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "k-seph_from_deficit", "score": 316, "comments": 45, "created_utc": 1769780667.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770225459, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "b4fc7372f37e41a948d44eb1b904dac79f1afdb1", "source": "reddit", "title": "How do you think the Spurs will navigate the Castle/Harper conundrum?", "body": "Per [NBA.com](http://NBA.com), Castle and Harper are shooting 35.4% and 30.7% on jumpshots, respectively.\n\n According to databallr, the Spurs have a -9.6 offensive rating in the 255 minutes they’ve shared the court.\n\nFor Harper’s high school and collegiate career, he shot under 33% on 3s and under 75% on free throws.\n\nCastle has been a sub-30% 3PT shooter and a sub-75% FT shooter dating all the way back to his senior year of high school.\n\nSo here are the factors at hand:\n\n1.

But this is where *context* matters:\n\n1. **The Celtics were a completely different tier of defensive team from the Spurs**.\n\nYes, RTS/relative efficiency “adjusts” for opponent defense, but it does so in a basically linear way, and that assumption is most reliable in normal matchups. It treats *playing a -4 defense* vs *playing a -9 defense* as mostly the same thing, just more of it. In outlier situations, I don't think it's a hot take to say that assumption might be challenged. A historically great defense doesn’t just shave a few points off league-average shot quality, it can change the entire shot distribution, force turnovers instead of just contested attempts, and load the primary action if the supporting cast can't punish help.  That’s what the 2008 Celtics series became: a defense that’s elite everywhere (rim, help, rotations, physicality) *plus* a matchup context (weak spacing / weak secondary creation) that lets them sell out at a level most “top defenses” simply can’t. So “-4 vs -9” isn’t just a 5-point difference on paper. It's a different category of constraint on what a heliocentric offense can even run.\n\n2) **Polar opposite Spacing and offensive cast differences:**\n\nThe 5 most played Heat players for LeBron lineups were : Wade, Bosh, Chalmers, Ray Allen, and Mike Miller, in order. According to advanced metric **Estimated Plus Minus**, here's where each of them graded out offensively that year:\n\n\\- Wade: +2.4 (*96th percentile)*\n\n*-* Bosh: +1.4 (*90th percentile)*\n\n*-* Chalmers: +1.3 (*89th percentile)*\n\n*-* Allen: +.7 (*79th percentile)*\n\n*-* Miller: +1.3 (*88th percentile)*\n\nThe Heat quickly abandoned double big lineups with Haslem, which were the norm in that era, for highly spaced ones, slanting offensively heavily. Of course it helped that Bosh was a well above average spacer at the 5 while also being good defensively, a rare skillset.\n\n\\---\n\nMeanwhile for the Cavs: Delonte West, Szczerbiak, Ilgauskas, Wallace, Joe Smith. Here's where each of them graded out offensively that year:\n\n\\- West: -1.9 (*35th percentile)*\n\n*-* Szczerbiak: -.2 (*66th percentile*)\n\n\\- Ilgauskas: +0, (*69th percentile)*\n\n*-* Wallace: -1.9 *(34th percentile)*\n\n*-* Smith: -.5 (*60th percentile)*\n\nThe Cavs took the opposite approach. Ben Wallace was acquired by the Cavs midway through the season in 2008. The Cavs only played 500 minutes the whole regular season with LeBron and Ben Wallace on the court, and LeBron's scoring numbers and the Cavs offense had suffered in those minutes, which was unsurprising given Wallace's glaring offensive issues. But the defense was strong. So the Cavs leaned into the defense against the Celtics.\n\nBottom line: The Cavs graded out as one of the worst offensive casts in the entire league, the Heat graded out as one of the best.\n\n\\---------------------\n\n# Narrative:\n\n**2013 LeBron:**\n\nPeople will point to Wade's underperformance in those finals, and the Spurs aggressively helping off of him, to contextualize what is from a production perspective an underperformance from a GOAT candidate at the perceived peak of his powers. Essentially:\n\n\"*While LeBron's production doesn't seem like an all time series, there are contextual factors that are being overlooked here, primarily LeBron not getting a lot of help from his co-stars, and the Spurs taking advantage of that to limit his scoring'*\n\nAdditionally, LeBron's Game 6 + Game 7 performances are indexed upon, to demonstrate that at the end of the day, there isn't really a defensive strategy that can truly limit his impact. In those final 2 games, he averaged: **39 pts, 8.5 assists per 100 on +7 RTS**, capping it off with a **37 point Game 7.**\n\nThe Spurs 'dared LeBron to shoot'. LeBron showed Pops that ultimately this cannot work, and in his own words: *\" I just told myself, don't abandon what you’ve done all year. Don’t abandon now because they’re going under. Don’t force the paint. If it’s there, take it. If not, take the jumper\".*\n\nA fitting victory of self belief for a LeBron who had now clearly established himself as one of the best players ever.\n\n**2008 LeBron:**\n\nAt the end of the day, LeBron was one of the premier superstars in the league. But he had clear deficits in his game that a great defensive team could expose, and his jumpshot was still very shakey, and a big weakness.\n\nIt may be true that the Celtics were a great defensive team, but might not have been quite as good as their regular season numbers suggested, as they went 7 games against Atlanta (*The Celtics had a +14 net rating that series, but apparently this is not as relevant as them going 7*).\n\nIt's also true that the Celtics held an MVP Kobe Bryant who had one of the best offensive casts in the league, *to below LeBron level scoring volume and neutral efficiency* in the finals, but perhaps this was an off series from Kobe. Rather than a signal that the Celtics had the capability of shutting off the water of superstars even in good offensive situations.\n\nNow.. LeBron did have a great game 6+7: **48 pts, 7.5 assists per 100 on +6.5 RTS,** and a **45 point Game 7**. But, it doesn't quite hit has hard, and this was probably more upward shooting variance than something repeatable *(In actuality, LeBron still shot sub 30% from 3 and sub 40% from midrang*e.  *His success came from getting to the rim at an absurd rate and being rewarded by free throws, which seems like some of the least 'variance' stuff imaginable. Just great process)*\n\n# What do I think:\n\nI think 2008 LeBron's ECSF was genuinely one of his more impressive playoff series of his career. It was one of the most outlier David vs. Goliath, superstar with poor  offensive cast going up against a great defensive team hell bent on stopping him, series in NBA history.\n\nIn that environment there isn’t a clean baseline for “what he’s supposed to look like,”\n\nHis jumper was extremely off early, and it never turned into some hot-streak outlier. But the process was fantastic, and he stayed committed to the highest-value outcome available: **Rim pressure, foul generation,** and he essentially proved that even Boston coverage couldn’t fully keep him off the paint or off the line. In fact, what he could put even more pressure, and draw even more fouls than in the regular season, with seemingly this extra gear he could tap into (*59 % FT Rate that series)*\n\nAnd it was a true 2 way performance. He was really damn good defensively and the anchor of the Cavs' defense, and consistently made plays that very few players in the league could make with his court coverage and motor.\n\nOverall, the reason this series hits harder for me than 2013 is that the setup was so hilariously broken in 2008. Miami could put four credible offensive players around LeBron. Cleveland could barely even put 1. In that exact context, even a -10 RTS collapse from most stars wouldn’t be surprising, you’d just shrug and say “there’s nowhere to go.”", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qm2gt2", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Aggressive_Bed6012", "score": 66, "comments": 65, "created_utc": 1769297217.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770225461, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "32a23d52f25c289320b6649a8f2efe422e8265ce", "source": "reddit", "title": "Why Shaq's PPG so low despite being so dominant?", "body": "I remember shaq being so dominant but am surprised that his PPG didn't get higher than 30 PPG average in a season.\n\nI figured it must be because he has very capable second/co-first scorer (penny then kobe) that he doesn't need to score so much.\n\nBut then again, some seasons that are without peak kobe or penny, he should have scored much higher.\n\nSo why do you think his PPG isn't higher like Jordan's 30+?\n\nMy reasoning are these. \n\n1. average points per game is historically lowest during his career\n\n2. very good 2nd scorer that takes points away from him\n\n  \ndo you all agree? any other reasons?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qkhs4l", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "thisnaenae", "score": 159, "comments": 222, "created_utc": 1769144512.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770225461, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "0f067fcfe58563c4ff85d74eed474d37b903d94d", "source": "reddit", "title": "What do you think are the final moves that will happen today and tomorrow?", "body": "I know there are like a million threads/discussions on this at this point, but I am curious to know what everyone thinks the next steps are and if there are any at all.

Is Cleveland just another example of teams putting too much weight on the current season production and not taking into account the variance in player production. \n\nClearly Harden has had a much better season to this date, but both Harden and Garland are pretty high variance players. Harden has been on a high and Garland has been low, but it really won't be that surprising to me if both players put up very similar production the rest of the year or if Garland is better in the second half of the season than Harden. \n\nHarden is also clearly at his best when he gets to be the first option. He seems to be the type of player that basically puts up the same efficiency regardless of how many shots he's taking. Honestly he might even be a player, who's efficiency goes up the more shots they take. I expect him to look worse playing second fiddle in Cleveland then he did as a first option for LAC.\n\nOverall this just seems really short-sighted by Cleveland. Harden is at the age where his production is likely to fall off a cliff at some point in the near future. That could be the second half of this season, more likely next season, almost guaranteed that his production falls off a cliff two seasons from now. Garland is 26, is having a very rough year, but just put up solid numbers last year and is likely to bounce back to form. maybe there are some medical issues with Garland that teams know about that I don't, that make this trade make more sense.\n\nMaybe Cleveland is a little bit closer to competing this year, but the long-term future just got a lot more bleak in my opinion. \n\nEdit: \n\nA lot of people seem to doubt that Garland was ever really that valuable of a player. Putting another reddit post down below that talks about Garlands value at his best. I personally think this is just a down year, but maybe I'm not aware that his injuries make him unlikely to ever be good again. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1cufr6k/how_good_is_darius_garland_for_those_interested/?utm_source=chatgpt.com", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qvpm1f", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Advanced-Turn-6878", "score": 44, "comments": 74, "created_utc": 1770214371.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770226152, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "bcbdec0a55438b5061c55574df2c9b807a139dfb", "source": "reddit", "title": "What is the deal with Lebron?", "body": "As a player he seems incredible watched a video where he gers compared to MJ and he's almost as good as him and seems to be one of the best players in the league at his prime and one of the best players all around.

Lakers get a lot of valuable pieces and all they are trading is an aging injury prone All-Nba player in AD, an up and coming 3&amp;D guard in Max Christie and a bunch of, to quote SAS, \"bonafide scrubs\" including a terrible D'Lo contract. All the while cashing in on a fever dream all time high valuation for DK. They do part with 2 unprotected firsts but its hard to believe that they will be in a good draft position with Luka having signed an extension.\n\nHell, all of the assets the lakers traded combined barely make a decent offer for just Luka, let alone a walking double double in Mark Williams and a valuable wing defender in DFS.

His teams were consistently top-heavy and lacking depth, which is the easiest way to catch criticism as a great #2 (like Blake) makes it much harder to attribute a playoff loss to “lack of help” than a poorly-constructed team. They also got injured at inopportune times, and the eventual conference winner pretty much always much better/deeper.\n\nLet’s go year-by-year and look who he lost to/the general West playoff landscape, and see if he could’ve been reasonably expected to win:\n\n‘08 Spurs - core of Duncan/Parker/Ginobili/Bowen/Finley. Chose ‘08 to not be accused of cherry-picking as they’re actually somewhat comparable here — Fin and Bowen were old, Barry and Horry were beyond washed. Nonetheless, CP3 still faced a supporting cast deficit and appropriately lost narrowly.\n\n‘09 Nuggets - Melo/still-prime Billups/Nene/Smith/Martin/Birdman/Kleiza had them clearly out-gunned, especially with Chandler’s injury.\n\n‘11 Lakers - laughable disparity. A rotation of Paul/Ariza/Belinelli/Okafor/Landry/Jack wasn’t gonna beat even a creaky Lakers team consisting of Kobe/Odom/Gasol/MWP/Fisher.\n\n‘12 Spurs - again just a ridiculous first round match-up. Paul-Griffin-Butler-Foye-young DAJ-young Bledsoe against Duncan/Parker/Ginobili/Green/Neal/Zygote Kawhi/Diaw/Splitter. If they beat them they’d have to face a much better Thunder team.\n\n‘13 Grizzlies - Paul/injured Blake/Barnes/Crawford/Bledsoe/pre-prime DAJ against Randolph/Conley/Gasol/Allen/Bayless/Prince and co. Not a total mismatch but we’re talking about an injured Clippers facing a 56 win team in the first round.\n\n‘14 Thunder - not a mismatch, Durant had a slightly better supporting cast, but still a roster deficit. The Spurs, of course, had a much deeper team.\n\n‘15 Rockets - not a mismatch, but Paul was injured. They lose in 7. They are likely not beating the Warriors even at full strength, and they beat a 55 win, defending champ Spurs team in the first round.\n\n‘16 Blazers - not a mismatch, CP3 has some culpability here, though again he was injured. Nonetheless, even if they won, they had the 73 win Warriors team awaiting them.\n\n‘17 Jazz - here Griffin was injured. Paul played very well but again drew a 50+ win team in the first round and again would’ve had to beat one of the best teams ever to even make the final.\n\nIn sum: even in early-round settings he usually faced a supporting cast deficit, with the team they lost to not even necessarily being the strongest team on offer, while having extremely poor injury luck in a historically stacked/lopsided conference.\n\nThere was never a year where they, even at full health, would’ve had a better supporting cast than the eventual conference winner. There was one when they were somewhat close (‘14), but still no cigar.\n\nNote: I am not a Paul fan, find him insufferable, and don’t regard him as a playoff riser by any means. But it sure does seem that, once you examine things year-by-year, it becomes difficult to pin their lack of playoff success squarely on his limitations as a #1 option. You put those same teams out East and it likely completely changes how the average fan sees him.

What about the OKC Thunder when it comes to Giannis? The thought of that had already been floating in my mind. And I'd love to hear everyone's opinions.\n\n**Is it time for Sam Presti to officially drop the hammer and go all-in for Giannis?**\n\nWe've been hearing the same story for the past couple of weeks. There are 4 teams that are routinely mentioned a ton and could \"really use\" Giannis and should try to trade for him. Those teams are GSW, MIN, MIA and NYK.\n\nBut let's be honest.\n\nNYK - Does MIL really want KAT, an 11-year vet who (in my opinion) has been steadily declining over the past few years and has arguably been one of the most injury-prone players since the 2019 season? Yes there's a possibility of someone like Bridges being included too, but is that what MIL envisions for their future? A lineup of Bridges, KAT and Myles Turner? Do they envision that being their team for the next 2-4 years? A kind of 41-41 or 44-38 team? Or do they want a FRESH restart, with young guys and top picks?\n\nMIN - I cannot envision a world where the Timberwolves offer enough to get Giannis. They have no draft capital, which means they'd literally have to give up the house for him. That means giving up Jaden McDaniels, Naz Reid, Julius Randle and probably Rob Dillingham, and likely their 2026 Pick. Maybe that's enough, but that creates a similar situation as the Knicks. Does MIL want to become a 40-44 win team that just kind of \"hangs around\" in the 8-10th seeds, or do they want to start completely fresh?\n\nMIA - Again, yet another situation where it just feels like a meh kind of offer. Tyler Herro, sure he can score, but he's a huge liability on defense. Ware is nice. Jaquez Jr is a solid, if not unspectacular addition. But again, feels like a team that would go 35, maybe 40 wins. Herro is also super injury prone.\n\nGSW - They probably have the best shot out of the 4 teams that are heavily mentioned. Kuminga matches the \"young talent that can grow\" that MIL might want...Moody is interesting as a throw-in. Lets be honest though, Jimmy isn't going to stay there. He's old now, and will be coming off an ACL tear. Brandon Pod is another meh addition to me, not someone you build around. The picks are nice, and probably what sets them apart from the other teams...albeit they are unprotected.\n\n**In come the Thunder. The team that \"doesn't need him at all\"...but has the most to offer to get him.**\n\nI believe whole-heartedly that this is the time for Sam Presti to go all-in. SGA is still young and just started the beginning of his prime. And an addition of someone like Giannis would honestly be the second coming of Shaq and Kobe in my opinion. Obviously different players and different styles, but having SGA and Giannis on the same team feels almost like a cheat code. And I believe that there are multiple ways for them to make this splash happen.\n\n* **Option 1**: OKC offers Ajay Mitchell, Aaron Wiggins, and (3) 1st Round Picks. I fully believe that Ajay Mitchell is a star in the making, and could very easily be a 20-5-6 guy if he were ever a starting job with 34 MPG. Wiggins as well has excelled when given the opportunity. Both are young up-and-coming players, and I believe are players you can build around. Or at minimum, are players you can use to surround whoever your next \"star\" is. The 3 First Round Picks as well give the Bucks the opportunity for that \"big reset\" as well.\n* **Option 2**: Could OKC do something even crazier, and give up Jalen Williams? Now I love me some Jalen Williams, but the honest-to-god truth is that J-Dub is *always* injured. Aside from his rookie season, feels like he's always battling some kind of injury or coming in with a GTD tag for some kind of nagging injury. He missed 11 games in 2024. He missed 13 games in 2025. He's already missed 20+ games this season and we're only at the 48-game mark. Never a good sign when someone this young (24 years old) is already missing this many games early in their career. Could the front office get frisky and dangerous....and actually offer up a package of Jalen Williams, along with someone like Wiggins and say (2) 1st Round Picks? It's definitely a crazier take, but if I'm the front office, I'm looking at every avenue.\n\nFor me, this is an easy win for the OKC Thunder. You secure what will essentially be the future of your franchise. Pairing Giannis with SGA for what would likely be at least the next  5-8 years, and having a legit shot at not one, not two, but multiple championship runs.\n\n**SGA, Lu Dort, Jalen Williams, Giannis, and Chet** as your starting five.\n\nI-Hart, Caruso, Cason Wallace, Jaylin Williams and Isaiah Joe are your 5 off the bench.\n\nMake this make sense to me on how this scenario isn't going through Presti's mind.\n\nI'd love to hear the communities thoughts.\n\n**/TLDR** \\- Thunder could be looking like the next dynasty if they go in for Giannis.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qrwz0w", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "anasazigb", "score": 75, "comments": 68, "created_utc": 1769848234.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770226153, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "3489da635232bdf742fd20d65b93d219999af9a2", "source": "reddit", "title": "What are your top 5 REALISTC destinations for Lebron that MAXIMIZES championship possibility but DOESN'T feel like ring chasing or team stacking?", "body": "A few assumptions - I assume that Lebron's age and clout and media circus will dissuade many teams from making a large financial commitment. I believe any contender that signs him will demand a discount well below a max contract. Any team capable of giving him a max contract is probably not a serious contender anyway\n\nRealistic -  the team wants Lebron and Lebron wants them too. Realistic teams are probably teams that don't feel like ring chasing. Realistic teams are clean skillset fits, money is reasonable, and have a decent/solid/ok chance at winning a title are more realistic\n\n1. Skillset fit - At this point Lebron is no longer a first option and his rim pressuring is also not reliable anymore. He's solidly a 2nd or third option on offense. What he still has in spades is passing, defensive playcalling, and offball cutting/spot up. A team which duplicates Lebron's skills probably won't want him because they won't benefit much from him.\n2. Money - IMO any team that wants to maximize Lebron's championship value, will have to offer him only about half the max salary. Lebron is simply not consistent enough, nor does he provide enough regular season value, especially due to missed games due to injury. Any team should basically only expect to benefit from him mostly in the playoffs. Relying in him during the regular season is expecting too much and a waste of his limited playing time\n3. Ring Chasing/Narrative - joining the defending champs (OKC), historic rivals (DEN, BOS, SAS) feels cheap, and doesn't feel like adding a lot to his legacy. Joining some random team (ORL, DET) without some story justification will look heavily like ring chasing or money chasing, depending on the circumstances, or feel pointless.\n\nThe only historic rival that kinda feels ok is GSW, only because Curry is the only guy in his era that matches Lebron in ring count and legacy points. Any ring that Lebron wins also gives Curry a ring, so it kinda cancels out and doesn't really feel like ring chasing, but provides story novelty for the fans.\n\nTo me best fits outside of LAL are CLE (story and skillset) and NYK (skillset).

In his sophomore season in 2020–21, he was 20 years old to start the season. He played 61 out of 72 possible games and averaged 27/7.2/3.7 on 64.9% TS% in 33.2 minutes per game.\n\nHere is how he compared to the other high-efficiency, high-volume scorers in the league that season:\n\n\\&gt; Stephen Curry: 32 PPG on 65.5 TS% in 62 games (MVP-3)\n\n\\&gt; Zion Williamson: 27 PPG on 64.9 TS% in 61 games\n\n\\&gt; Nikola Jokić: 26.4 PPG on 64.7 TS% in 72 games (MVP-1)\n\n\\&gt; Joel Embiid: 28.5 PPG on 63.6 TS% in 51 games (MVP-2)\n\n\\&gt; Giannis Antetokounmpo: 28.1 PPG on 63.3 TS% in 61 games (MVP-4)\n\nBasically, Stephen Curry was the only player that season who scored significantly more points than Zion at a similar (negligibly higher) efficiency. The only four players in Zion’s vicinity were ranked 1st through 4th in MVP voting. I am not claiming he was a better player than the others listed that season — only that what he did in terms of high volume combined with efficiency was historically extraordinary for a 20-year-old sophomore scorer. Zion did not crack even an All-NBA Third Team that season.\n\nIf we compare this to other scoring seasons by players who were 20 years old to start the season, there are only three other examples of a player scoring 25+ PPG. For the sake of fairness, if you adjust all four seasons to 2026 league-average TS% (58%) and standardize pace to 75 possessions, you get:\n\n\\&gt; Zion Williamson ’21: 29.3 PP75 on 65.8 TS%, 113.5 Adjusted TS%\n\n\\&gt; Kevin Durant ’09: 26.6 PP75 on 61.6 TS%, 106.1 Adjusted TS%\n\n\\&gt; LeBron James ’05: 28.2 PP75 on 60.7 TS%, 104.7 Adjusted TS%\n\n\\&gt; Luka Dončić ’20: 31.9 PP75 on 59.9 TS%, 103.4 Adjusted TS%\n\nAgain, the difference in efficiency is striking, and those three players are very likely among the top 10 greatest offensive players of all time.\n\nThese are the only two seasons this decade in which players averaged both more adjusted points per 75 and a higher adjusted TS% than Zion Williamson in 2021 (29.3 PP75 on 65.8 TS%, 113.5 ATS%):\n\n\\&gt; 2020–21 Stephen Curry: 32.4 PP75 on 66.4 TS%, 114.5 ATS%\n\n\\&gt; 2021–22 Nikola Jokić: 30.5 PP75 on 67.7 TS%, 116.8 ATS%\n\nEven if you relax the requirement to include approximate cases or extremes in either volume or efficiency, the only three additional seasons you could reasonably add are:\n\n\\&gt; Jokić ’23 (much higher efficiency at much lower volume)\n\n\\&gt; Embiid ’23 (much higher volume at slightly lower efficiency)\n\n\\&gt; Jokić ’25 (slightly lower volume at slightly higher efficiency)\n\n⸻\n\nFinally, here’s a list of all players with 65+ games played (or on pace in a shortened season), averaging 25+ PPG on 110+ adjusted TS% in the last 10 years (Zion, as discussed, had 27 PPG on 113.5+ TS% so the efficiency standards are significantly lower than Zion’s season):\n\n1. SGA ’25 (MVP)\n\n2. Jokić ’25 (MVP-2)\n\n3. Giannis ’24 (MVP-4)\n\n4. Jokić ’24 (MVP)\n\n5. Jokić ’23 (MVP-2)\n\n6. Embiid ’23 (MVP)\n\n7. Jokić ’22 (MVP)\n\n8. Curry ’21 (MVP-3)\n\n9. Giannis ’21 (MVP-4)\n\n10. Jokić ’21 (MVP-1)\n\n11. Harden ’20 (MVP-1)\n\n12. Lillard ’20 (All-NBA Second Team)\n\n13. Giannis ’19 (MVP-1)\n\n14. Curry ’19 (MVP-5)\n\n15. Harden ’19 (MVP-2)\n\n16.

Curry ’17 (All-NBA Second Team)\n\n23. Harden ’17 (MVP-2)\n\n24. LeBron ’17 (MVP-4)\n\nThat’s 20/25 top MVP finishes and out of the other 4, 3 deserved it but were shafted due to them belonging to KD and Steph on the warriors, 1 Lillard second team All-NBA season and 1 Zion season without all-league accolades. \n\nI understand that Zion injured himself towards the end of the season but that was after playing 85% of the season. His team was also 11th that season. However, apparently those considerations only apply if you don’t have a HOF career before the season. \n\nFor example, Lillard in ‘23 played only 70% of the season (58 games) AND injured himself at the end of the season AND was on the 13th seed. Despite a much worse triple whammy, he still made All-NBA. Luka (who is my favourite player) got the benefit of the doubt in ‘23 (deservedly) to make the friggin first team on the 11th seed after missing more games. LeBron in the same season as Zion played a mere 45 games in ‘21 and made second team All NBA on a 7th seed team in large part due to him being LeBron James and his momentum from winning FMVP the previous year. \n\nAnyway, \n\n1. Do you think Zion’s season is underrated? \n\n2. Do you think he deserved a slot on the second or third team? \n\n3. Do you think the voters feeling his production was unsustainable and the timing of his injury played a part in him not getting all-league accolades?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qr5u4f", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "k-seph_from_deficit", "score": 320, "comments": 45, "created_utc": 1769780667.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770226154, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "08fb9cdddea317e8dbb682feef787c3a789289ee", "source": "reddit", "title": "How do you think the Spurs will navigate the Castle/Harper conundrum?", "body": "Per [NBA.com](http://NBA.com), Castle and Harper are shooting 35.4% and 30.7% on jumpshots, respectively.\n\n According to databallr, the Spurs have a -9.6 offensive rating in the 255 minutes they’ve shared the court.\n\nFor Harper’s high school and collegiate career, he shot under 33% on 3s and under 75% on free throws.\n\nCastle has been a sub-30% 3PT shooter and a sub-75% FT shooter dating all the way back to his senior year of high school.\n\nSo here are the factors at hand:\n\n1.

But this is where *context* matters:\n\n1. **The Celtics were a completely different tier of defensive team from the Spurs**.\n\nYes, RTS/relative efficiency “adjusts” for opponent defense, but it does so in a basically linear way, and that assumption is most reliable in normal matchups. It treats *playing a -4 defense* vs *playing a -9 defense* as mostly the same thing, just more of it. In outlier situations, I don't think it's a hot take to say that assumption might be challenged. A historically great defense doesn’t just shave a few points off league-average shot quality, it can change the entire shot distribution, force turnovers instead of just contested attempts, and load the primary action if the supporting cast can't punish help.  That’s what the 2008 Celtics series became: a defense that’s elite everywhere (rim, help, rotations, physicality) *plus* a matchup context (weak spacing / weak secondary creation) that lets them sell out at a level most “top defenses” simply can’t. So “-4 vs -9” isn’t just a 5-point difference on paper. It's a different category of constraint on what a heliocentric offense can even run.\n\n2) **Polar opposite Spacing and offensive cast differences:**\n\nThe 5 most played Heat players for LeBron lineups were : Wade, Bosh, Chalmers, Ray Allen, and Mike Miller, in order. According to advanced metric **Estimated Plus Minus**, here's where each of them graded out offensively that year:\n\n\\- Wade: +2.4 (*96th percentile)*\n\n*-* Bosh: +1.4 (*90th percentile)*\n\n*-* Chalmers: +1.3 (*89th percentile)*\n\n*-* Allen: +.7 (*79th percentile)*\n\n*-* Miller: +1.3 (*88th percentile)*\n\nThe Heat quickly abandoned double big lineups with Haslem, which were the norm in that era, for highly spaced ones, slanting offensively heavily. Of course it helped that Bosh was a well above average spacer at the 5 while also being good defensively, a rare skillset.\n\n\\---\n\nMeanwhile for the Cavs: Delonte West, Szczerbiak, Ilgauskas, Wallace, Joe Smith. Here's where each of them graded out offensively that year:\n\n\\- West: -1.9 (*35th percentile)*\n\n*-* Szczerbiak: -.2 (*66th percentile*)\n\n\\- Ilgauskas: +0, (*69th percentile)*\n\n*-* Wallace: -1.9 *(34th percentile)*\n\n*-* Smith: -.5 (*60th percentile)*\n\nThe Cavs took the opposite approach. Ben Wallace was acquired by the Cavs midway through the season in 2008. The Cavs only played 500 minutes the whole regular season with LeBron and Ben Wallace on the court, and LeBron's scoring numbers and the Cavs offense had suffered in those minutes, which was unsurprising given Wallace's glaring offensive issues. But the defense was strong. So the Cavs leaned into the defense against the Celtics.\n\nBottom line: The Cavs graded out as one of the worst offensive casts in the entire league, the Heat graded out as one of the best.\n\n\\---------------------\n\n# Narrative:\n\n**2013 LeBron:**\n\nPeople will point to Wade's underperformance in those finals, and the Spurs aggressively helping off of him, to contextualize what is from a production perspective an underperformance from a GOAT candidate at the perceived peak of his powers. Essentially:\n\n\"*While LeBron's production doesn't seem like an all time series, there are contextual factors that are being overlooked here, primarily LeBron not getting a lot of help from his co-stars, and the Spurs taking advantage of that to limit his scoring'*\n\nAdditionally, LeBron's Game 6 + Game 7 performances are indexed upon, to demonstrate that at the end of the day, there isn't really a defensive strategy that can truly limit his impact. In those final 2 games, he averaged: **39 pts, 8.5 assists per 100 on +7 RTS**, capping it off with a **37 point Game 7.**\n\nThe Spurs 'dared LeBron to shoot'. LeBron showed Pops that ultimately this cannot work, and in his own words: *\" I just told myself, don't abandon what you’ve done all year. Don’t abandon now because they’re going under. Don’t force the paint. If it’s there, take it. If not, take the jumper\".*\n\nA fitting victory of self belief for a LeBron who had now clearly established himself as one of the best players ever.\n\n**2008 LeBron:**\n\nAt the end of the day, LeBron was one of the premier superstars in the league. But he had clear deficits in his game that a great defensive team could expose, and his jumpshot was still very shakey, and a big weakness.\n\nIt may be true that the Celtics were a great defensive team, but might not have been quite as good as their regular season numbers suggested, as they went 7 games against Atlanta (*The Celtics had a +14 net rating that series, but apparently this is not as relevant as them going 7*).\n\nIt's also true that the Celtics held an MVP Kobe Bryant who had one of the best offensive casts in the league, *to below LeBron level scoring volume and neutral efficiency* in the finals, but perhaps this was an off series from Kobe. Rather than a signal that the Celtics had the capability of shutting off the water of superstars even in good offensive situations.\n\nNow.. LeBron did have a great game 6+7: **48 pts, 7.5 assists per 100 on +6.5 RTS,** and a **45 point Game 7**. But, it doesn't quite hit has hard, and this was probably more upward shooting variance than something repeatable *(In actuality, LeBron still shot sub 30% from 3 and sub 40% from midrang*e.  *His success came from getting to the rim at an absurd rate and being rewarded by free throws, which seems like some of the least 'variance' stuff imaginable. Just great process)*\n\n# What do I think:\n\nI think 2008 LeBron's ECSF was genuinely one of his more impressive playoff series of his career. It was one of the most outlier David vs. Goliath, superstar with poor  offensive cast going up against a great defensive team hell bent on stopping him, series in NBA history.\n\nIn that environment there isn’t a clean baseline for “what he’s supposed to look like,”\n\nHis jumper was extremely off early, and it never turned into some hot-streak outlier. But the process was fantastic, and he stayed committed to the highest-value outcome available: **Rim pressure, foul generation,** and he essentially proved that even Boston coverage couldn’t fully keep him off the paint or off the line. In fact, what he could put even more pressure, and draw even more fouls than in the regular season, with seemingly this extra gear he could tap into (*59 % FT Rate that series)*\n\nAnd it was a true 2 way performance. He was really damn good defensively and the anchor of the Cavs' defense, and consistently made plays that very few players in the league could make with his court coverage and motor.\n\nOverall, the reason this series hits harder for me than 2013 is that the setup was so hilariously broken in 2008. Miami could put four credible offensive players around LeBron. Cleveland could barely even put 1. In that exact context, even a -10 RTS collapse from most stars wouldn’t be surprising, you’d just shrug and say “there’s nowhere to go.”", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qm2gt2", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Aggressive_Bed6012", "score": 69, "comments": 65, "created_utc": 1769297217.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770226156, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "5583de748aa57995be778a827ea8272c490e8e84", "source": "reddit", "title": "Why Shaq's PPG so low despite being so dominant?", "body": "I remember shaq being so dominant but am surprised that his PPG didn't get higher than 30 PPG average in a season.\n\nI figured it must be because he has very capable second/co-first scorer (penny then kobe) that he doesn't need to score so much.\n\nBut then again, some seasons that are without peak kobe or penny, he should have scored much higher.\n\nSo why do you think his PPG isn't higher like Jordan's 30+?\n\nMy reasoning are these. \n\n1. average points per game is historically lowest during his career\n\n2. very good 2nd scorer that takes points away from him\n\n  \ndo you all agree? any other reasons?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qkhs4l", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "thisnaenae", "score": 164, "comments": 222, "created_utc": 1769144512.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770226156, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "ba9a623fbaf8b782fe6f891b8f8ff235000abb89", "source": "reddit", "title": "What do you think are the final moves that will happen today and tomorrow?", "body": "I know there are like a million threads/discussions on this at this point, but I am curious to know what everyone thinks the next steps are and if there are any at all.

Is Cleveland just another example of teams putting too much weight on the current season production and not taking into account the variance in player production. \n\nClearly Harden has had a much better season to this date, but both Harden and Garland are pretty high variance players. Harden has been on a high and Garland has been low, but it really won't be that surprising to me if both players put up very similar production the rest of the year or if Garland is better in the second half of the season than Harden. \n\nHarden is also clearly at his best when he gets to be the first option. He seems to be the type of player that basically puts up the same efficiency regardless of how many shots he's taking. Honestly he might even be a player, who's efficiency goes up the more shots they take. I expect him to look worse playing second fiddle in Cleveland then he did as a first option for LAC.\n\nOverall this just seems really short-sighted by Cleveland. Harden is at the age where his production is likely to fall off a cliff at some point in the near future. That could be the second half of this season, more likely next season, almost guaranteed that his production falls off a cliff two seasons from now. Garland is 26, is having a very rough year, but just put up solid numbers last year and is likely to bounce back to form. maybe there are some medical issues with Garland that teams know about that I don't, that make this trade make more sense.\n\nMaybe Cleveland is a little bit closer to competing this year, but the long-term future just got a lot more bleak in my opinion. \n\nEdit: \n\nA lot of people seem to doubt that Garland was ever really that valuable of a player. Putting another reddit post down below that talks about Garlands value at his best. I personally think this is just a down year, but maybe I'm not aware that his injuries make him unlikely to ever be good again. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1cufr6k/how_good_is_darius_garland_for_those_interested/?utm_source=chatgpt.com", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qvpm1f", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Advanced-Turn-6878", "score": 48, "comments": 78, "created_utc": 1770214371.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770227490, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "3f8b95636e446d52dac5999dc0e12f5f763e29cb", "source": "reddit", "title": "What is the deal with Lebron?", "body": "As a player he seems incredible watched a video where he gers compared to MJ and he's almost as good as him and seems to be one of the best players in the league at his prime and one of the best players all around.

Lakers get a lot of valuable pieces and all they are trading is an aging injury prone All-Nba player in AD, an up and coming 3&amp;D guard in Max Christie and a bunch of, to quote SAS, \"bonafide scrubs\" including a terrible D'Lo contract. All the while cashing in on a fever dream all time high valuation for DK. They do part with 2 unprotected firsts but its hard to believe that they will be in a good draft position with Luka having signed an extension.\n\nHell, all of the assets the lakers traded combined barely make a decent offer for just Luka, let alone a walking double double in Mark Williams and a valuable wing defender in DFS.

His teams were consistently top-heavy and lacking depth, which is the easiest way to catch criticism as a great #2 (like Blake) makes it much harder to attribute a playoff loss to “lack of help” than a poorly-constructed team. They also got injured at inopportune times, and the eventual conference winner pretty much always much better/deeper.\n\nLet’s go year-by-year and look who he lost to/the general West playoff landscape, and see if he could’ve been reasonably expected to win:\n\n‘08 Spurs - core of Duncan/Parker/Ginobili/Bowen/Finley. Chose ‘08 to not be accused of cherry-picking as they’re actually somewhat comparable here — Fin and Bowen were old, Barry and Horry were beyond washed. Nonetheless, CP3 still faced a supporting cast deficit and appropriately lost narrowly.\n\n‘09 Nuggets - Melo/still-prime Billups/Nene/Smith/Martin/Birdman/Kleiza had them clearly out-gunned, especially with Chandler’s injury.\n\n‘11 Lakers - laughable disparity. A rotation of Paul/Ariza/Belinelli/Okafor/Landry/Jack wasn’t gonna beat even a creaky Lakers team consisting of Kobe/Odom/Gasol/MWP/Fisher.\n\n‘12 Spurs - again just a ridiculous first round match-up. Paul-Griffin-Butler-Foye-young DAJ-young Bledsoe against Duncan/Parker/Ginobili/Green/Neal/Zygote Kawhi/Diaw/Splitter. If they beat them they’d have to face a much better Thunder team.\n\n‘13 Grizzlies - Paul/injured Blake/Barnes/Crawford/Bledsoe/pre-prime DAJ against Randolph/Conley/Gasol/Allen/Bayless/Prince and co. Not a total mismatch but we’re talking about an injured Clippers facing a 56 win team in the first round.\n\n‘14 Thunder - not a mismatch, Durant had a slightly better supporting cast, but still a roster deficit. The Spurs, of course, had a much deeper team.\n\n‘15 Rockets - not a mismatch, but Paul was injured. They lose in 7. They are likely not beating the Warriors even at full strength, and they beat a 55 win, defending champ Spurs team in the first round.\n\n‘16 Blazers - not a mismatch, CP3 has some culpability here, though again he was injured. Nonetheless, even if they won, they had the 73 win Warriors team awaiting them.\n\n‘17 Jazz - here Griffin was injured. Paul played very well but again drew a 50+ win team in the first round and again would’ve had to beat one of the best teams ever to even make the final.\n\nIn sum: even in early-round settings he usually faced a supporting cast deficit, with the team they lost to not even necessarily being the strongest team on offer, while having extremely poor injury luck in a historically stacked/lopsided conference.\n\nThere was never a year where they, even at full health, would’ve had a better supporting cast than the eventual conference winner. There was one when they were somewhat close (‘14), but still no cigar.\n\nNote: I am not a Paul fan, find him insufferable, and don’t regard him as a playoff riser by any means. But it sure does seem that, once you examine things year-by-year, it becomes difficult to pin their lack of playoff success squarely on his limitations as a #1 option. You put those same teams out East and it likely completely changes how the average fan sees him.

Those teams are GSW, MIN, MIA and NYK.\n\nBut let's be honest.\n\nNYK - Does MIL really want KAT, an 11-year vet who (in my opinion) has been steadily declining over the past few years and has arguably been one of the most injury-prone players since the 2019 season? Yes there's a possibility of someone like Bridges being included too, but is that what MIL envisions for their future? A lineup of Bridges, KAT and Myles Turner? Do they envision that being their team for the next 2-4 years? A kind of 41-41 or 44-38 team? Or do they want a FRESH restart, with young guys and top picks?\n\nMIN - I cannot envision a world where the Timberwolves offer enough to get Giannis. They have no draft capital, which means they'd literally have to give up the house for him. That means giving up Jaden McDaniels, Naz Reid, Julius Randle and probably Rob Dillingham, and likely their 2026 Pick. Maybe that's enough, but that creates a similar situation as the Knicks. Does MIL want to become a 40-44 win team that just kind of \"hangs around\" in the 8-10th seeds, or do they want to start completely fresh?\n\nMIA - Again, yet another situation where it just feels like a meh kind of offer. Tyler Herro, sure he can score, but he's a huge liability on defense. Ware is nice. Jaquez Jr is a solid, if not unspectacular addition. But again, feels like a team that would go 35, maybe 40 wins. Herro is also super injury prone.\n\nGSW - They probably have the best shot out of the 4 teams that are heavily mentioned. Kuminga matches the \"young talent that can grow\" that MIL might want...Moody is interesting as a throw-in. Lets be honest though, Jimmy isn't going to stay there. He's old now, and will be coming off an ACL tear. Brandon Pod is another meh addition to me, not someone you build around. The picks are nice, and probably what sets them apart from the other teams...albeit they are unprotected.\n\n**In come the Thunder. The team that \"doesn't need him at all\"...but has the most to offer to get him.**\n\nI believe whole-heartedly that this is the time for Sam Presti to go all-in. SGA is still young and just started the beginning of his prime. And an addition of someone like Giannis would honestly be the second coming of Shaq and Kobe in my opinion. Obviously different players and different styles, but having SGA and Giannis on the same team feels almost like a cheat code. And I believe that there are multiple ways for them to make this splash happen.\n\n* **Option 1**: OKC offers Ajay Mitchell, Aaron Wiggins, and (3) 1st Round Picks. I fully believe that Ajay Mitchell is a star in the making, and could very easily be a 20-5-6 guy if he were ever a starting job with 34 MPG. Wiggins as well has excelled when given the opportunity. Both are young up-and-coming players, and I believe are players you can build around. Or at minimum, are players you can use to surround whoever your next \"star\" is. The 3 First Round Picks as well give the Bucks the opportunity for that \"big reset\" as well.\n* **Option 2**: Could OKC do something even crazier, and give up Jalen Williams? Now I love me some Jalen Williams, but the honest-to-god truth is that J-Dub is *always* injured. Aside from his rookie season, feels like he's always battling some kind of injury or coming in with a GTD tag for some kind of nagging injury. He missed 11 games in 2024. He missed 13 games in 2025. He's already missed 20+ games this season and we're only at the 48-game mark. Never a good sign when someone this young (24 years old) is already missing this many games early in their career. Could the front office get frisky and dangerous....and actually offer up a package of Jalen Williams, along with someone like Wiggins and say (2) 1st Round Picks? It's definitely a crazier take, but if I'm the front office, I'm looking at every avenue.\n\nFor me, this is an easy win for the OKC Thunder. You secure what will essentially be the future of your franchise. Pairing Giannis with SGA for what would likely be at least the next  5-8 years, and having a legit shot at not one, not two, but multiple championship runs.\n\n**SGA, Lu Dort, Jalen Williams, Giannis, and Chet** as your starting five.\n\nI-Hart, Caruso, Cason Wallace, Jaylin Williams and Isaiah Joe are your 5 off the bench.\n\nMake this make sense to me on how this scenario isn't going through Presti's mind.\n\nI'd love to hear the communities thoughts.\n\n**/TLDR** \\- Thunder could be looking like the next dynasty if they go in for Giannis.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qrwz0w", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "anasazigb", "score": 74, "comments": 69, "created_utc": 1769848234.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770227491, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "23f2ff16fa9938fb0abdabf37288db20bb4b128a", "source": "reddit", "title": "What are your top 5 REALISTC destinations for Lebron that MAXIMIZES championship possibility but DOESN'T feel like ring chasing or team stacking?", "body": "A few assumptions - I assume that Lebron's age and clout and media circus will dissuade many teams from making a large financial commitment. I believe any contender that signs him will demand a discount well below a max contract. Any team capable of giving him a max contract is probably not a serious contender anyway\n\nRealistic -  the team wants Lebron and Lebron wants them too. Realistic teams are probably teams that don't feel like ring chasing. Realistic teams are clean skillset fits, money is reasonable, and have a decent/solid/ok chance at winning a title are more realistic\n\n1. Skillset fit - At this point Lebron is no longer a first option and his rim pressuring is also not reliable anymore. He's solidly a 2nd or third option on offense. What he still has in spades is passing, defensive playcalling, and offball cutting/spot up. A team which duplicates Lebron's skills probably won't want him because they won't benefit much from him.\n2. Money - IMO any team that wants to maximize Lebron's championship value, will have to offer him only about half the max salary. Lebron is simply not consistent enough, nor does he provide enough regular season value, especially due to missed games due to injury. Any team should basically only expect to benefit from him mostly in the playoffs. Relying in him during the regular season is expecting too much and a waste of his limited playing time\n3. Ring Chasing/Narrative - joining the defending champs (OKC), historic rivals (DEN, BOS, SAS) feels cheap, and doesn't feel like adding a lot to his legacy. Joining some random team (ORL, DET) without some story justification will look heavily like ring chasing or money chasing, depending on the circumstances, or feel pointless.\n\nThe only historic rival that kinda feels ok is GSW, only because Curry is the only guy in his era that matches Lebron in ring count and legacy points. Any ring that Lebron wins also gives Curry a ring, so it kinda cancels out and doesn't really feel like ring chasing, but provides story novelty for the fans.\n\nTo me best fits outside of LAL are CLE (story and skillset) and NYK (skillset).

In his sophomore season in 2020–21, he was 20 years old to start the season. He played 61 out of 72 possible games and averaged 27/7.2/3.7 on 64.9% TS% in 33.2 minutes per game.\n\nHere is how he compared to the other high-efficiency, high-volume scorers in the league that season:\n\n\\&gt; Stephen Curry: 32 PPG on 65.5 TS% in 62 games (MVP-3)\n\n\\&gt; Zion Williamson: 27 PPG on 64.9 TS% in 61 games\n\n\\&gt; Nikola Jokić: 26.4 PPG on 64.7 TS% in 72 games (MVP-1)\n\n\\&gt; Joel Embiid: 28.5 PPG on 63.6 TS% in 51 games (MVP-2)\n\n\\&gt; Giannis Antetokounmpo: 28.1 PPG on 63.3 TS% in 61 games (MVP-4)\n\nBasically, Stephen Curry was the only player that season who scored significantly more points than Zion at a similar (negligibly higher) efficiency. The only four players in Zion’s vicinity were ranked 1st through 4th in MVP voting. I am not claiming he was a better player than the others listed that season — only that what he did in terms of high volume combined with efficiency was historically extraordinary for a 20-year-old sophomore scorer. Zion did not crack even an All-NBA Third Team that season.\n\nIf we compare this to other scoring seasons by players who were 20 years old to start the season, there are only three other examples of a player scoring 25+ PPG. For the sake of fairness, if you adjust all four seasons to 2026 league-average TS% (58%) and standardize pace to 75 possessions, you get:\n\n\\&gt; Zion Williamson ’21: 29.3 PP75 on 65.8 TS%, 113.5 Adjusted TS%\n\n\\&gt; Kevin Durant ’09: 26.6 PP75 on 61.6 TS%, 106.1 Adjusted TS%\n\n\\&gt; LeBron James ’05: 28.2 PP75 on 60.7 TS%, 104.7 Adjusted TS%\n\n\\&gt; Luka Dončić ’20: 31.9 PP75 on 59.9 TS%, 103.4 Adjusted TS%\n\nAgain, the difference in efficiency is striking, and those three players are very likely among the top 10 greatest offensive players of all time.\n\nThese are the only two seasons this decade in which players averaged both more adjusted points per 75 and a higher adjusted TS% than Zion Williamson in 2021 (29.3 PP75 on 65.8 TS%, 113.5 ATS%):\n\n\\&gt; 2020–21 Stephen Curry: 32.4 PP75 on 66.4 TS%, 114.5 ATS%\n\n\\&gt; 2021–22 Nikola Jokić: 30.5 PP75 on 67.7 TS%, 116.8 ATS%\n\nEven if you relax the requirement to include approximate cases or extremes in either volume or efficiency, the only three additional seasons you could reasonably add are:\n\n\\&gt; Jokić ’23 (much higher efficiency at much lower volume)\n\n\\&gt; Embiid ’23 (much higher volume at slightly lower efficiency)\n\n\\&gt; Jokić ’25 (slightly lower volume at slightly higher efficiency)\n\n⸻\n\nFinally, here’s a list of all players with 65+ games played (or on pace in a shortened season), averaging 25+ PPG on 110+ adjusted TS% in the last 10 years (Zion, as discussed, had 27 PPG on 113.5+ TS% so the efficiency standards are significantly lower than Zion’s season):\n\n1. SGA ’25 (MVP)\n\n2. Jokić ’25 (MVP-2)\n\n3. Giannis ’24 (MVP-4)\n\n4. Jokić ’24 (MVP)\n\n5. Jokić ’23 (MVP-2)\n\n6. Embiid ’23 (MVP)\n\n7. Jokić ’22 (MVP)\n\n8. Curry ’21 (MVP-3)\n\n9. Giannis ’21 (MVP-4)\n\n10. Jokić ’21 (MVP-1)\n\n11. Harden ’20 (MVP-1)\n\n12. Lillard ’20 (All-NBA Second Team)\n\n13. Giannis ’19 (MVP-1)\n\n14. Curry ’19 (MVP-5)\n\n15. Harden ’19 (MVP-2)\n\n16. Durant ’19 (All-NBA Second Team)\n\n17. Durant ’18 (All-NBA First Team)\n\n18. LeBron ’18 (MVP-2)\n\n19. Harden ’18 (MVP-1)\n\n20. Anthony Davis ’18 (MVP-3)\n\n21. Isaiah Thomas ’17 (MVP-5)\n\n22. Curry ’17 (All-NBA Second Team)\n\n23. Harden ’17 (MVP-2)\n\n24. LeBron ’17 (MVP-4)\n\nThat’s 20/25 top MVP finishes and out of the other 4, 3 deserved it but were shafted due to them belonging to KD and Steph on the warriors, 1 Lillard second team All-NBA season and 1 Zion season without all-league accolades. \n\nI understand that Zion injured himself towards the end of the season but that was after playing 85% of the season. His team was also 11th that season. However, apparently those considerations only apply if you don’t have a HOF career before the season. \n\nFor example, Lillard in ‘23 played only 70% of the season (58 games) AND injured himself at the end of the season AND was on the 13th seed. Despite a much worse triple whammy, he still made All-NBA. Luka (who is my favourite player) got the benefit of the doubt in ‘23 (deservedly) to make the friggin first team on the 11th seed after missing more games. LeBron in the same season as Zion played a mere 45 games in ‘21 and made second team All NBA on a 7th seed team in large part due to him being LeBron James and his momentum from winning FMVP the previous year. \n\nAnyway, \n\n1. Do you think Zion’s season is underrated? \n\n2. Do you think he deserved a slot on the second or third team? \n\n3. Do you think the voters feeling his production was unsustainable and the timing of his injury played a part in him not getting all-league accolades?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qr5u4f", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "k-seph_from_deficit", "score": 317, "comments": 45, "created_utc": 1769780667.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770227492, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "487563e4ff9200a6212d77b30b9c78a3146e103d", "source": "reddit", "title": "How do you think the Spurs will navigate the Castle/Harper conundrum?", "body": "Per [NBA.com](http://NBA.com), Castle and Harper are shooting 35.4% and 30.7% on jumpshots, respectively.\n\n According to databallr, the Spurs have a -9.6 offensive rating in the 255 minutes they’ve shared the court.\n\nFor Harper’s high school and collegiate career, he shot under 33% on 3s and under 75% on free throws.\n\nCastle has been a sub-30% 3PT shooter and a sub-75% FT shooter dating all the way back to his senior year of high school.\n\nSo here are the factors at hand:\n\n1.

But this is where *context* matters:\n\n1. **The Celtics were a completely different tier of defensive team from the Spurs**.\n\nYes, RTS/relative efficiency “adjusts” for opponent defense, but it does so in a basically linear way, and that assumption is most reliable in normal matchups. It treats *playing a -4 defense* vs *playing a -9 defense* as mostly the same thing, just more of it. In outlier situations, I don't think it's a hot take to say that assumption might be challenged. A historically great defense doesn’t just shave a few points off league-average shot quality, it can change the entire shot distribution, force turnovers instead of just contested attempts, and load the primary action if the supporting cast can't punish help.  That’s what the 2008 Celtics series became: a defense that’s elite everywhere (rim, help, rotations, physicality) *plus* a matchup context (weak spacing / weak secondary creation) that lets them sell out at a level most “top defenses” simply can’t. So “-4 vs -9” isn’t just a 5-point difference on paper. It's a different category of constraint on what a heliocentric offense can even run.\n\n2) **Polar opposite Spacing and offensive cast differences:**\n\nThe 5 most played Heat players for LeBron lineups were : Wade, Bosh, Chalmers, Ray Allen, and Mike Miller, in order. According to advanced metric **Estimated Plus Minus**, here's where each of them graded out offensively that year:\n\n\\- Wade: +2.4 (*96th percentile)*\n\n*-* Bosh: +1.4 (*90th percentile)*\n\n*-* Chalmers: +1.3 (*89th percentile)*\n\n*-* Allen: +.7 (*79th percentile)*\n\n*-* Miller: +1.3 (*88th percentile)*\n\nThe Heat quickly abandoned double big lineups with Haslem, which were the norm in that era, for highly spaced ones, slanting offensively heavily. Of course it helped that Bosh was a well above average spacer at the 5 while also being good defensively, a rare skillset.\n\n\\---\n\nMeanwhile for the Cavs: Delonte West, Szczerbiak, Ilgauskas, Wallace, Joe Smith. Here's where each of them graded out offensively that year:\n\n\\- West: -1.9 (*35th percentile)*\n\n*-* Szczerbiak: -.2 (*66th percentile*)\n\n\\- Ilgauskas: +0, (*69th percentile)*\n\n*-* Wallace: -1.9 *(34th percentile)*\n\n*-* Smith: -.5 (*60th percentile)*\n\nThe Cavs took the opposite approach. Ben Wallace was acquired by the Cavs midway through the season in 2008. The Cavs only played 500 minutes the whole regular season with LeBron and Ben Wallace on the court, and LeBron's scoring numbers and the Cavs offense had suffered in those minutes, which was unsurprising given Wallace's glaring offensive issues. But the defense was strong. So the Cavs leaned into the defense against the Celtics.\n\nBottom line: The Cavs graded out as one of the worst offensive casts in the entire league, the Heat graded out as one of the best.\n\n\\---------------------\n\n# Narrative:\n\n**2013 LeBron:**\n\nPeople will point to Wade's underperformance in those finals, and the Spurs aggressively helping off of him, to contextualize what is from a production perspective an underperformance from a GOAT candidate at the perceived peak of his powers. Essentially:\n\n\"*While LeBron's production doesn't seem like an all time series, there are contextual factors that are being overlooked here, primarily LeBron not getting a lot of help from his co-stars, and the Spurs taking advantage of that to limit his scoring'*\n\nAdditionally, LeBron's Game 6 + Game 7 performances are indexed upon, to demonstrate that at the end of the day, there isn't really a defensive strategy that can truly limit his impact. In those final 2 games, he averaged: **39 pts, 8.5 assists per 100 on +7 RTS**, capping it off with a **37 point Game 7.**\n\nThe Spurs 'dared LeBron to shoot'. LeBron showed Pops that ultimately this cannot work, and in his own words: *\" I just told myself, don't abandon what you’ve done all year. Don’t abandon now because they’re going under. Don’t force the paint. If it’s there, take it. If not, take the jumper\".*\n\nA fitting victory of self belief for a LeBron who had now clearly established himself as one of the best players ever.\n\n**2008 LeBron:**\n\nAt the end of the day, LeBron was one of the premier superstars in the league. But he had clear deficits in his game that a great defensive team could expose, and his jumpshot was still very shakey, and a big weakness.\n\nIt may be true that the Celtics were a great defensive team, but might not have been quite as good as their regular season numbers suggested, as they went 7 games against Atlanta (*The Celtics had a +14 net rating that series, but apparently this is not as relevant as them going 7*).\n\nIt's also true that the Celtics held an MVP Kobe Bryant who had one of the best offensive casts in the league, *to below LeBron level scoring volume and neutral efficiency* in the finals, but perhaps this was an off series from Kobe. Rather than a signal that the Celtics had the capability of shutting off the water of superstars even in good offensive situations.\n\nNow.. LeBron did have a great game 6+7: **48 pts, 7.5 assists per 100 on +6.5 RTS,** and a **45 point Game 7**. But, it doesn't quite hit has hard, and this was probably more upward shooting variance than something repeatable *(In actuality, LeBron still shot sub 30% from 3 and sub 40% from midrang*e.  *His success came from getting to the rim at an absurd rate and being rewarded by free throws, which seems like some of the least 'variance' stuff imaginable. Just great process)*\n\n# What do I think:\n\nI think 2008 LeBron's ECSF was genuinely one of his more impressive playoff series of his career. It was one of the most outlier David vs. Goliath, superstar with poor  offensive cast going up against a great defensive team hell bent on stopping him, series in NBA history.\n\nIn that environment there isn’t a clean baseline for “what he’s supposed to look like,”\n\nHis jumper was extremely off early, and it never turned into some hot-streak outlier. But the process was fantastic, and he stayed committed to the highest-value outcome available: **Rim pressure, foul generation,** and he essentially proved that even Boston coverage couldn’t fully keep him off the paint or off the line. In fact, what he could put even more pressure, and draw even more fouls than in the regular season, with seemingly this extra gear he could tap into (*59 % FT Rate that series)*\n\nAnd it was a true 2 way performance. He was really damn good defensively and the anchor of the Cavs' defense, and consistently made plays that very few players in the league could make with his court coverage and motor.\n\nOverall, the reason this series hits harder for me than 2013 is that the setup was so hilariously broken in 2008. Miami could put four credible offensive players around LeBron. Cleveland could barely even put 1. In that exact context, even a -10 RTS collapse from most stars wouldn’t be surprising, you’d just shrug and say “there’s nowhere to go.”", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qm2gt2", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Aggressive_Bed6012", "score": 71, "comments": 65, "created_utc": 1769297217.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770227493, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "dda991b5c4f2fe82d63d764e431cbd309d5e39c7", "source": "reddit", "title": "Why Shaq's PPG so low despite being so dominant?", "body": "I remember shaq being so dominant but am surprised that his PPG didn't get higher than 30 PPG average in a season.\n\nI figured it must be because he has very capable second/co-first scorer (penny then kobe) that he doesn't need to score so much.\n\nBut then again, some seasons that are without peak kobe or penny, he should have scored much higher.\n\nSo why do you think his PPG isn't higher like Jordan's 30+?\n\nMy reasoning are these. \n\n1. average points per game is historically lowest during his career\n\n2. very good 2nd scorer that takes points away from him\n\n  \ndo you all agree? any other reasons?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qkhs4l", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "thisnaenae", "score": 156, "comments": 222, "created_utc": 1769144512.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770227493, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "dd9caa3439443a05cc80cad742a8e95e509949ca", "source": "reddit", "title": "What do you think are the final moves that will happen today and tomorrow?", "body": "I know there are like a million threads/discussions on this at this point, but I am curious to know what everyone thinks the next steps are and if there are any at all.

He's the reason why we're able to contend, I'll never forget him and his 2022 days. Now, let's get started:\n\nThe Age Gap\nThe first thing I immediately noticed once this rumored trade was spread around my time-line is the age gap. We're lucky James Harden hasn't sustained a major career injury since 2021, because this would've looked like a really bad trade. James is 36, and Darius is 26, a 10-year age gap. Our next oldest player is Larry Nance Jr at 33, and Dennis Schroder at 32. The combined age for this roster is now 27, so we're getting older and closer to win now mode, which leads to my second problem: \n\n*\"Win-Now Mode\"\nI heard from multiple Cavs fans that James Harden is a \"proven winner.\" I genuinely can't believe that comes out of some people's mouths, but even if he is, we're hinging on the fact that it's championship or bust for the next two seasons, meaning Mobley and Allen cannot fail to fuck up. Once you're not able to win during a window, you NEED to have a back-up plan, regardless. With LeBron James rumored to come back to Cleveland for one more season, the memories will be there, but it's important to know what our future looks like after Harden and LeBron, and right now, all of the front-offices chips seem to be put on Jaylon Tyson and Evan Mobley to lead the future of this team. Depending on the playoff results, that picture may or may not include Donovan Mitchell. \n\nPlayoff Choker \nThe biggest one of them all in my opinion. How can a team, who's looking to get over the hump, who's known for choking in the post-season add one of the GREATEST playoff chokers in modern NBA history. I'm just going to go through the individual games and you let me know if this is consistent play from a hall-of-fame player? \n\n2015 vs GSW (G5)\nJames Harden: 14 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists, 13 turnovers.\n\n2016 vs SA (G6)\nJames Harden: 10 points, 7 assists, 6 turnovers, 3 rebounds \n\n2022 vs MIA (G5)\nJames Harden: 14 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists, 4 turnovers\n\n2022 vs MIA (G6)\nJames Harden: 11 points, 9 assists, 4 turnovers \n\n2023 vs PHI (G6)\nJames Harden: 13 points, 9 assists, 7 rebounds, 5 turnovers, 4 stocks \n\n2023 vs PHI (G7)\nJames Harden: 9 points, 7 assists, 5 turnovers, 6 rebounds, 3 stocks \n\n2024 vs DAL (G5)\nJames Harden: 7 points, 7 assists, 4 turnovers, 4 rebounds \n\n2025 vs DEN (G5)\nJames Harden: 11 points, 8 rebounds, 5 assists, 4 turnovers \n\n2025 vs DEN (G7)\nJames Harden: 7 points, 13 assists, 5 rebounds, 2 turnovers \n\nI could go on and on, he's a playoff choker. It's not just him having bad performances, its the multiple times we've caught him checked out of a game and not playing any sort of defense to help his team get back. At-least Darius Garland would put in 110% effort on a bad shooting night. Also, defensively, we're still about the same as Harden. Yes, he's a dealing with a much more defensive team in the Cavs, who rely on their front-court to be the motor, and he's a bigger defensive side, but he's not the same age as some of our players, nor do I think he's going to bring the same effort on the court because of what he could bring offensively to the table, which is my next segway... \n\nOffensive Pace \nA big reason why the Cavaliers are so good offensively is due to their pace, and ability to get looks off of the transition with ease. Let's compare the offensive paces from our 2024-25 season to now, including the offensive pace for the Clippers with Harden as the offensive leader:\n\nCavs\n2024-25 season: \nPace: 99.8 (10th in NBA).\nOffensive Rating: 121.7 (1st in NBA).\nPoints Per Game: 121.9 (1st in NBA).\n\nCavs\n2025-26 season: \nPace: 101.1 (7th in NBA)\nOffensive Rating: 117.6 (9th in NBA)\nPoints Per Game: 119.3 (5th in NBA)\n\n-----\nClippers\n2024-25 season:\nPace: 97.5 (22nd in the NBA)\nOffensive Rating: 115.1 (14th in NBA)\nPoints: 112.9 (20th in NBA) \n\nClippers \n2025-26 season: \nPace: 95.9 (25th in the NBA)\nOffensive Rating: 116.8 (12th in NBA)\nPoints: 112.7 (25th in NBA)\n\nThe Clippers are an older roster, and do rely more on shot-making from Kawhi and Harden, so this makes sense, but the stark difference in pace and offensive rating, coupled with a 36-year old who's not going to be able to give 200% on both sides of the ball, probably makes our offensive pace slower, especially when Harden's out there with the second unit and Mitchell is benched. If we increase the pace, there's more risk of injury for older players, like Harden, Merrill, Strus, etc. In today's NBA, your conditioning needs to be spot on, and Harden has done a great job at that so far, but he's in a much more youthful team with a high pace, a likeliness for transition breakaways, and high energy plays. \n\nThere's no doubt that James Harden's shot-making and ability to space the floor will make us more efficient, but at the same time we're losing pace, which 9/10's going to bring our points down with him on the floor along with our pace. We have seen the Cavaliers go on streaks of slow offensive pace, and this could be the trade to try and accommodate Harden into our offense, rather them him accommodating into ours. Which brings me to my next point. \n\nJames Harden Himself \nI think this trade is showing that the front-office is probably going to get LeBron James to rejoin the Cavaliers in his 3rd stint and have his farewell tour. I don't mind it. I think LeBron James deserves that from us, but the cost remains to be seen. We're hoping he takes a paycut and does it out of love. Right now, from what I'm hearing, we're willing to give him his coveted 2-year, $80M deal, and all this hinges on the fact that we're able to make it to a finals appearance or win the championship in June. Because if we can't, Mitchell's probably declining his player-option and we're probably going to start rebuilding sooner than later. \n\nJames Harden is a very up-front person, but he's not a player we should trust, AT all.\n\n[Via New York Times]\nJames Harden wanted to retire with 76ers, but 'front office didn't have that in their future plans. \n\n[Via JoeyLin - Twitter]\n“Once I leave and retire from being a Clipper, hopefully that culture can continue leading to something special.”\n\nJames Harden wants to leave a legacy with the Clippers. He also hopes people can begin understanding who he really is.\n\nSimply put, he's not trustworthy, and if we're going to give him a $40M extension, and he's declining in production and age, we're not helping ourselves in freeing money from the books, or having cap space to build for the future. We own three second round picks in the next six years, and two first round picks in the next four years, which have a bunch of stipulations. \n\n2026 FRP: Less favorable of (i) less favorable of (a) CLE and (b) more favorable of UTH 1-8 and MIN [or (i) CLE if UTH not conveyable] and (ii) less favorable of ATL and SAN then more favorable of (i) and (ii) to ATL;\nmost / more favorable of CLE, MIN and UTH 1-8 to UTH\n(via UTH swap for MIN; via UTH swap of UTH or MIN for CLE; via SAN swap for ATL; via ATL swap of ATL or SAN for CLE, UTH or MIN)\n\n2028 FRP: Least favorable of CLE, UTH and ATL;\nmore favorable of CLE and UTH to UTH;\nmore favorable of (i) ATL and (ii) less favorable of CLE and UTH to ATL\n(via UTH swap for CLE; via ATL swap for CLE or UTH)\n\nMostly all of the picks have a lot of stipulations, which is going to be revealed in all due time. James Harden is simply here for the money and for himself, which credit to him, it's worked for majority of his career, but we shouldn't trust him, and we shouldn't go ALL-IN because we won't have a back-up plan and there's not going to be anyone to save us. \n\nDoes anyone remember the mood after LeBron James left in 2018? The roster was destroyed, left with old veterans who clearly didn't fit the timeline of his team and G-League players. We drafted Collin Sexton, which I'm forever grateful that he panned out. Darius Garland even started his Cavalier' career rough, missing a bunch of games to a knee injury and simply not being able to shoot the basketball. The front-office was able to hit on 2 out of the 3 picks, which is a miracle for a franchise who's had some blunders over the past years, with Anthony Bennett being the most notable out of all of them. James Harden knows how to control the offensive game of the pace, but his play-style isn't pretty, and it's going to make the game slow for the rest of our players, unless he's willing to buy in and change that. \n\nObviously, with Strus returning and Merrill getting more games under his belt, I think we're still going to be one of the best offenses in the league, but with majority of the team not performing to their standard in multiple games in the playoffs, coupled with a player you can't trust, a known playoff dropper, and a shooting guard who struggles to get out of the second round (whether it's his fault or not), it's going to be a miracle for this to be fixed, and it feels like we're asking for another disappointing season at this point. \n\nI'm pretty sure we're not done trading, but if the roster looks like this come playoff time, a lot of it is going to hinge on Mitchell being able to play off-ball with James Harden. With two players who love having the ball in their hands, this creates problems from us, especially in the offense. This will most likely have Mitchell and Harden split minutes to have their own run at the offense while they're in the game. James Harden is a pass-first player, but he needs the ball to really execute on that. Also, this forces Evan Mobley to probably be another wing player, as two big men nearing the same vicinity on the court only clog things up. Luckily, Evan's been developing a three-point shot, which is much needed for a 5-out. The Cavs attempt around 41 threes a game, which is in the top five. We also like to neglect the paint sometimes and shoot-chuck threes every while, which doesn't make sense to me. James Harden doesn’t spring us to championship contenders in my opinion, so where’s this going…\n\nI could talk about the fit, our issues with rebounding in the post-season, and our tendency to resort to iso ball in the post-season after spending a whole regular season dictating the offensive pace of games and ball-movement. I hate this trade for the Cavaliers, and for someone who's been a fan of this team, I'm willing to eat my words (literally I'll print out this post and eat it), if we win a championship. But unless our bench (the likes of Tyson, Merrill, Ellis, Schroder, Strus and Tomlin) have massive improvements in the post-season and can deliver timely plays, I don't see how this is going to work out, and I truly do fear the worst for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the next two years. I understand Darius Garland wasn't able to play, and that severely hampered our ability to win a championship, but putting all your chips on a 36-year old to suddenly have a change of heart and identity is not the way to do it, and you certainly don't panic now, you let it unravel in the off-season, or in the season prior. For a franchise to do this, I'm assuming Darius Garland is going to be out for the next 1 1/2 years on the Clippers, because that toe might need two plates in it when he's playing basketball. \n\nToodles.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qw212u", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Southern_Tackle_6754", "score": 0, "comments": 8, "created_utc": 1770241517.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770262149, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "66db80be8c35c72ae3e83a754b92a6e365af3326", "source": "reddit", "title": "A Pacers Package for Giannis", "body": "I'm a Pacers fan, and I'm not sure I'd want this... but couldn't the Pacers put together one of the best trade packages for Giannis?\n\nObi Toppin\n\nAndrew Nembhard\n\nBen Mathurin\n\nJarace Walker\n\nIsaiah Jackson\n\nTheir 2026 pick\n\na few more picks\n\nThat's 3 young players that will likely get better, and Toppin who is a quality role player.

Is Cleveland just another example of teams putting too much weight on the current season production and not taking into account the variance in player production. \n\nClearly Harden has had a much better season to this date, but both Harden and Garland are pretty high variance players. Harden has been on a high and Garland has been low, but it really won't be that surprising to me if both players put up very similar production the rest of the year or if Garland is better in the second half of the season than Harden. \n\nHarden is also clearly at his best when he gets to be the first option. He seems to be the type of player that basically puts up the same efficiency regardless of how many shots he's taking. Honestly he might even be a player, who's efficiency goes up the more shots they take. I expect him to look worse playing second fiddle in Cleveland then he did as a first option for LAC.\n\nOverall this just seems really short-sighted by Cleveland. Harden is at the age where his production is likely to fall off a cliff at some point in the near future. That could be the second half of this season, more likely next season, almost guaranteed that his production falls off a cliff two seasons from now. Garland is 26, is having a very rough year, but just put up solid numbers last year and is likely to bounce back to form. maybe there are some medical issues with Garland that teams know about that I don't, that make this trade make more sense.\n\nMaybe Cleveland is a little bit closer to competing this year, but the long-term future just got a lot more bleak in my opinion. \n\nEdit: \n\nA lot of people seem to doubt that Garland was ever really that valuable of a player. Putting another reddit post down below that talks about Garlands value at his best. I personally think this is just a down year, but maybe I'm not aware that his injuries make him unlikely to ever be good again. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1cufr6k/how_good_is_darius_garland_for_those_interested/?utm_source=chatgpt.com", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qvpm1f", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Advanced-Turn-6878", "score": 95, "comments": 112, "created_utc": 1770214371.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770262150, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "e01ce6ced61838b519a5344374ecc66e67f2e1de", "source": "reddit", "title": "What is the deal with Lebron?", "body": "As a player he seems incredible watched a video where he gers compared to MJ and he's almost as good as him and seems to be one of the best players in the league at his prime and one of the best players all around.

His teams were consistently top-heavy and lacking depth, which is the easiest way to catch criticism as a great #2 (like Blake) makes it much harder to attribute a playoff loss to “lack of help” than a poorly-constructed team. They also got injured at inopportune times, and the eventual conference winner pretty much always much better/deeper.\n\nLet’s go year-by-year and look who he lost to/the general West playoff landscape, and see if he could’ve been reasonably expected to win:\n\n‘08 Spurs - core of Duncan/Parker/Ginobili/Bowen/Finley. Chose ‘08 to not be accused of cherry-picking as they’re actually somewhat comparable here — Fin and Bowen were old, Barry and Horry were beyond washed. Nonetheless, CP3 still faced a supporting cast deficit and appropriately lost narrowly.\n\n‘09 Nuggets - Melo/still-prime Billups/Nene/Smith/Martin/Birdman/Kleiza had them clearly out-gunned, especially with Chandler’s injury.\n\n‘11 Lakers - laughable disparity. A rotation of Paul/Ariza/Belinelli/Okafor/Landry/Jack wasn’t gonna beat even a creaky Lakers team consisting of Kobe/Odom/Gasol/MWP/Fisher.\n\n‘12 Spurs - again just a ridiculous first round match-up. Paul-Griffin-Butler-Foye-young DAJ-young Bledsoe against Duncan/Parker/Ginobili/Green/Neal/Zygote Kawhi/Diaw/Splitter. If they beat them they’d have to face a much better Thunder team.\n\n‘13 Grizzlies - Paul/injured Blake/Barnes/Crawford/Bledsoe/pre-prime DAJ against Randolph/Conley/Gasol/Allen/Bayless/Prince and co. Not a total mismatch but we’re talking about an injured Clippers facing a 56 win team in the first round.\n\n‘14 Thunder - not a mismatch, Durant had a slightly better supporting cast, but still a roster deficit. The Spurs, of course, had a much deeper team.\n\n‘15 Rockets - not a mismatch, but Paul was injured. They lose in 7. They are likely not beating the Warriors even at full strength, and they beat a 55 win, defending champ Spurs team in the first round.\n\n‘16 Blazers - not a mismatch, CP3 has some culpability here, though again he was injured. Nonetheless, even if they won, they had the 73 win Warriors team awaiting them.\n\n‘17 Jazz - here Griffin was injured. Paul played very well but again drew a 50+ win team in the first round and again would’ve had to beat one of the best teams ever to even make the final.\n\nIn sum: even in early-round settings he usually faced a supporting cast deficit, with the team they lost to not even necessarily being the strongest team on offer, while having extremely poor injury luck in a historically stacked/lopsided conference.\n\nThere was never a year where they, even at full health, would’ve had a better supporting cast than the eventual conference winner. There was one when they were somewhat close (‘14), but still no cigar.\n\nNote: I am not a Paul fan, find him insufferable, and don’t regard him as a playoff riser by any means. But it sure does seem that, once you examine things year-by-year, it becomes difficult to pin their lack of playoff success squarely on his limitations as a #1 option. You put those same teams out East and it likely completely changes how the average fan sees him.

Both of these guys are extremely overrated and can’t shoot threes. Neither of them have superstar 2nd option championship potential.

The longer a coach stays with a team the more a fan base will key in on their deficiencies but completely disregard the huge benefits they bring to a roster. \n\nPeople view coaching as something that will just build from year to year which is often not the case. For example if Coach Bud had the Bucks doing 5 things at an elite level, but he was fired for 2 other things he was deficient at,  people just assume that those 5 positive things will remain with the team and those deficiencies can just be improved on with a new coach. Around all major sports we see this is often not the case.  Those positives that people start to trivialize aren't inherent to that roster, and were actually key pieces to that coach's coaching philosophy that people start minimizing over time.\n\nAs someone who viewed the Bucks as a conference powerhouse under Bud...to see him get fired after a playoff series in which Giannis missed 2 out of the 5 games (1 in which he only played 10 minutes). In a series he was coaching while his Brother died, was just insanity to me. \n\nThe way the Bucks fanbase/organization treated Bud was disgraceful, and they deserve everything that is currently happening with them.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qs0101", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "FaradayDeshawn", "score": 344, "comments": 38, "created_utc": 1769859108.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770262151, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "7ae00d288f164067360d4e13fe34d78b9dc7d4f5", "source": "reddit", "title": "Is now the time for Sam Presti to go all-in on for Giannis?", "body": "Very recently, the First Take crew brought up the question. What about the OKC Thunder when it comes to Giannis? The thought of that had already been floating in my mind. And I'd love to hear everyone's opinions.\n\n**Is it time for Sam Presti to officially drop the hammer and go all-in for Giannis?**\n\nWe've been hearing the same story for the past couple of weeks. There are 4 teams that are routinely mentioned a ton and could \"really use\" Giannis and should try to trade for him. Those teams are GSW, MIN, MIA and NYK.\n\nBut let's be honest.\n\nNYK - Does MIL really want KAT, an 11-year vet who (in my opinion) has been steadily declining over the past few years and has arguably been one of the most injury-prone players since the 2019 season? Yes there's a possibility of someone like Bridges being included too, but is that what MIL envisions for their future? A lineup of Bridges, KAT and Myles Turner? Do they envision that being their team for the next 2-4 years? A kind of 41-41 or 44-38 team? Or do they want a FRESH restart, with young guys and top picks?\n\nMIN - I cannot envision a world where the Timberwolves offer enough to get Giannis. They have no draft capital, which means they'd literally have to give up the house for him. That means giving up Jaden McDaniels, Naz Reid, Julius Randle and probably Rob Dillingham, and likely their 2026 Pick. Maybe that's enough, but that creates a similar situation as the Knicks. Does MIL want to become a 40-44 win team that just kind of \"hangs around\" in the 8-10th seeds, or do they want to start completely fresh?\n\nMIA - Again, yet another situation where it just feels like a meh kind of offer. Tyler Herro, sure he can score, but he's a huge liability on defense. Ware is nice. Jaquez Jr is a solid, if not unspectacular addition. But again, feels like a team that would go 35, maybe 40 wins. Herro is also super injury prone.\n\nGSW - They probably have the best shot out of the 4 teams that are heavily mentioned. Kuminga matches the \"young talent that can grow\" that MIL might want...Moody is interesting as a throw-in. Lets be honest though, Jimmy isn't going to stay there. He's old now, and will be coming off an ACL tear. Brandon Pod is another meh addition to me, not someone you build around. The picks are nice, and probably what sets them apart from the other teams...albeit they are unprotected.\n\n**In come the Thunder. The team that \"doesn't need him at all\"...but has the most to offer to get him.**\n\nI believe whole-heartedly that this is the time for Sam Presti to go all-in. SGA is still young and just started the beginning of his prime. And an addition of someone like Giannis would honestly be the second coming of Shaq and Kobe in my opinion. Obviously different players and different styles, but having SGA and Giannis on the same team feels almost like a cheat code. And I believe that there are multiple ways for them to make this splash happen.\n\n* **Option 1**: OKC offers Ajay Mitchell, Aaron Wiggins, and (3) 1st Round Picks. I fully believe that Ajay Mitchell is a star in the making, and could very easily be a 20-5-6 guy if he were ever a starting job with 34 MPG. Wiggins as well has excelled when given the opportunity. Both are young up-and-coming players, and I believe are players you can build around. Or at minimum, are players you can use to surround whoever your next \"star\" is. The 3 First Round Picks as well give the Bucks the opportunity for that \"big reset\" as well.\n* **Option 2**: Could OKC do something even crazier, and give up Jalen Williams? Now I love me some Jalen Williams, but the honest-to-god truth is that J-Dub is *always* injured. Aside from his rookie season, feels like he's always battling some kind of injury or coming in with a GTD tag for some kind of nagging injury. He missed 11 games in 2024. He missed 13 games in 2025. He's already missed 20+ games this season and we're only at the 48-game mark. Never a good sign when someone this young (24 years old) is already missing this many games early in their career. Could the front office get frisky and dangerous....and actually offer up a package of Jalen Williams, along with someone like Wiggins and say (2) 1st Round Picks? It's definitely a crazier take, but if I'm the front office, I'm looking at every avenue.\n\nFor me, this is an easy win for the OKC Thunder. You secure what will essentially be the future of your franchise. Pairing Giannis with SGA for what would likely be at least the next  5-8 years, and having a legit shot at not one, not two, but multiple championship runs.\n\n**SGA, Lu Dort, Jalen Williams, Giannis, and Chet** as your starting five.\n\nI-Hart, Caruso, Cason Wallace, Jaylin Williams and Isaiah Joe are your 5 off the bench.\n\nMake this make sense to me on how this scenario isn't going through Presti's mind.\n\nI'd love to hear the communities thoughts.\n\n**/TLDR** \\- Thunder could be looking like the next dynasty if they go in for Giannis.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qrwz0w", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "anasazigb", "score": 77, "comments": 70, "created_utc": 1769848234.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770262151, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "b53db442d763d9079379fa783d29a41a22aa8c35", "source": "reddit", "title": "What are your top 5 REALISTC destinations for Lebron that MAXIMIZES championship possibility but DOESN'T feel like ring chasing or team stacking?", "body": "A few assumptions - I assume that Lebron's age and clout and media circus will dissuade many teams from making a large financial commitment. I believe any contender that signs him will demand a discount well below a max contract. Any team capable of giving him a max contract is probably not a serious contender anyway\n\nRealistic -  the team wants Lebron and Lebron wants them too. Realistic teams are probably teams that don't feel like ring chasing. Realistic teams are clean skillset fits, money is reasonable, and have a decent/solid/ok chance at winning a title are more realistic\n\n1. Skillset fit - At this point Lebron is no longer a first option and his rim pressuring is also not reliable anymore. He's solidly a 2nd or third option on offense. What he still has in spades is passing, defensive playcalling, and offball cutting/spot up. A team which duplicates Lebron's skills probably won't want him because they won't benefit much from him.\n2. Money - IMO any team that wants to maximize Lebron's championship value, will have to offer him only about half the max salary. Lebron is simply not consistent enough, nor does he provide enough regular season value, especially due to missed games due to injury. Any team should basically only expect to benefit from him mostly in the playoffs. Relying in him during the regular season is expecting too much and a waste of his limited playing time\n3. Ring Chasing/Narrative - joining the defending champs (OKC), historic rivals (DEN, BOS, SAS) feels cheap, and doesn't feel like adding a lot to his legacy. Joining some random team (ORL, DET) without some story justification will look heavily like ring chasing or money chasing, depending on the circumstances, or feel pointless.\n\nThe only historic rival that kinda feels ok is GSW, only because Curry is the only guy in his era that matches Lebron in ring count and legacy points. Any ring that Lebron wins also gives Curry a ring, so it kinda cancels out and doesn't really feel like ring chasing, but provides story novelty for the fans.\n\nTo me best fits outside of LAL are CLE (story and skillset) and NYK (skillset).

It had comments but they were mostly low-quality. Or your post asked a straightforward question that can be answered in one word or sentence, or by Googling it. Try posting in our weekly questions thread instead.\n* *“My post met the requirements and is high quality but was still removed.*”\n   * Use in-depth arguments to support your opinion. Our sub is looking for posts that dig deeper than the minimum, examining the full context of a player or coach or team, how they changed, grew, and adjusted throughout their career, including the quality of their opponents and cultural impact of their celebrity; how they affected and improved their teammates, responded to coaches, what strategies they employed for different situations and challenges. Etc.\n* *“Why do posts/comments have a minimum character requirement? Why do you remove short posts and comments? Why don’t you let upvotes and downvotes decide?”*\n   * Our goal in this sub is to have a space for high-quality discussion. High-quality requires extra effort. Low-effort posts and comments are not only easier to write but to read, so even in a community where all the users are seeking high-quality, low-effort posts and comments will still garner more upvotes and more attention. If we allow low-effort posts and comments to remain, the community will gravitate towards them, pushing high-effort and high-quality posts and comments to the bottom. This encourages people to put in less effort. Removing them allows high-quality posts and comments to have space at the top, encouraging people to put in more effort in their own comments and posts.\n\nThere are still plenty of active NBA subs where users can enjoy making jokes or memes, or that welcome hot takes, and hyperbole (such as r/NBATalk, r/nbacirclejerk, or r/nba).

What I discovered requires immediate escalation to leadership.\n\n**The situation:** The Brooklyn Nets are running the most sophisticated trade value manipulation scheme I have seen in my brief, unqualified tenure in speculative basketball operations.\n\n**The target:** [Day'Ron Sharpe](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/sharpda01.html), a 24-year-old backup center making $6.2 million annually.\n\n**The con:** Brooklyn is suppressing Sharpe's minutes while showcasing [Nic Claxton](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/claxtni01.html) ($97M/4yr) to inflate trade value, despite Sharpe posting _superior performance metrics_.\n\n**Bottom line:** The Nets are soft-tanking, while selling fool's gold (Claxton) and hiding actual gold (Sharpe).\n\n### SITUATION REPORT\n\n#### The Performance Gap\n\nI reviewed the [Nets' 2025-26 three-man lineup data](https://www.nba.com/stats/lineups/advanced?CF=MIN*GE*30&amp;GroupQuantity=3&amp;TeamID=1610612751&amp;dir=A&amp;slug=advanced&amp;sort=DEF_RATING). The findings are, to use technical basketball operations terminology, _\"fucking bonkers.\"_\n\n**Sharpe's Best Defensive Lineups:**\n\n- Sharpe + Williams + Saraf: 79.8 DefRtg (44 minutes)\n- Sharpe + Mann + Williams: 82.6 DefRtg (32 minutes)  \n- Sharpe + Wilson + Wolf: 85.6 DefRtg (59 minutes)\n\n**Claxton's \"Defensive Anchor\" Lineups:**\n\n- Claxton + Clowney + Traore: 98.3 DefRtg (55 minutes)\n- Claxton + Porter + Wolf: 99.2 DefRtg (58 minutes)\n- Most Claxton lineups: 100+ DefRtg \n\n\n#### The Offensive Surprise\n\nThe conventional wisdom suggests Claxton is the more polished offensive player. The lineup data suggests conventional wisdom should—at its earliest convenience—kindly go fuck itself.\n\n- **Porter + Sharpe + Clowney:** 130.7 OffRtg  \n- **Porter + Claxton + Clowney:** 113.2 OffRtg\n\n- **Porter + Mann + Sharpe:** 141.1 OffRtg (35.8 NetRtg)  \n- **Porter + Mann + Claxton:** 112.8 OffRtg (-5.1 NetRtg)\n\nI'm no mathematician (_420 SAT math_), but these numbers represent _\"a significant difference?\"_\n\n#### The Minutes Conspiracy\n\nYes, the sample sizes are small. That isn’t an accident; it’s the strategy. This is why the Nets’ plan is so cunning. Here is where the operation becomes transparent:\n\nSharpe's best-performing lineups are receiving drastically fewer minutes than Claxton's inferior lineups. This is not coaching incompetence—Jordi Fernández is smarter than that. This is *deliberate roster management*.\n\n**The Nets' Strategy (Decoded):**\n\n1. Showcase Claxton to contenders (Warriors, Pacers) as \"defensive anchor\"\n2. Let him accumulate starter minutes despite worse performance\n3. Keep Sharpe's sample size small—less tape = less competition in trade talks\n4. Trade Claxton for actual assets (picks, young players)\n5. Immediately hand starting job to Sharpe, who's already better\n6. Continue tanking with improved defense and $23M in cap relief\n\nThis is not just smart, it's *diabolical*. Intentional or convenient, Claxton’s value is being amplified, and Sharpe’s is being contained.\n\n### RECOMMENDATION\n\n**ACQUIRE DAY'RON SHARPE IMMEDIATELY**\n\n#### The Fit\n\nSharpe checks every box discussed in [Episode 3 of the Bulls Back Office podcast](https://bullsbackoffice.com/#post?s=e3_centers_of_attention):\n\n- ✓ Defensive presence at the rim\n- ✓ Perfect timeline match with the core  \n- ✓ Cheap enough to maintain flexibility\n- ✓ Physical enough to bang with Embiid/Giannis types\n- ✓ Actually good at basketball (per the data)\n- ✓ Passing vision for Horns and Split Action sets\n\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\nBrooklyn is running a masterclass in trade value manipulation. They're hiding their best center on the bench; preserving his low price. And shopping their overpaid \"starter\" to teams who don't watch film.\n\nThe Intern  \nBulls Back Office Research Division  \n\n**CC:** Bulls Nation (because someone has to know what competent roster construction looks like)", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qw6gxc", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "brineonmars", "score": 19, "comments": 3, "created_utc": 1770252164.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770307462, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "cc746ed957981289b9287050870fab5bc15878ef", "source": "reddit", "title": "This has the potential to be one of the worst trades in Cavs' history", "body": "First and foremost, I wish the best of luck to Darius Garland. He's the reason why we're able to contend, I'll never forget him and his 2022 days. Now, let's get started:\n\nThe Age Gap\nThe first thing I immediately noticed once this rumored trade was spread around my time-line is the age gap. We're lucky James Harden hasn't sustained a major career injury since 2021, because this would've looked like a really bad trade. James is 36, and Darius is 26, a 10-year age gap. Our next oldest player is Larry Nance Jr at 33, and Dennis Schroder at 32. The combined age for this roster is now 27, so we're getting older and closer to win now mode, which leads to my second problem: \n\n*\"Win-Now Mode\"\nI heard from multiple Cavs fans that James Harden is a \"proven winner.\" I genuinely can't believe that comes out of some people's mouths, but even if he is, we're hinging on the fact that it's championship or bust for the next two seasons, meaning Mobley and Allen cannot fail to fuck up. Once you're not able to win during a window, you NEED to have a back-up plan, regardless. With LeBron James rumored to come back to Cleveland for one more season, the memories will be there, but it's important to know what our future looks like after Harden and LeBron, and right now, all of the front-offices chips seem to be put on Jaylon Tyson and Evan Mobley to lead the future of this team. Depending on the playoff results, that picture may or may not include Donovan Mitchell. \n\nPlayoff Choker \nThe biggest one of them all in my opinion. How can a team, who's looking to get over the hump, who's known for choking in the post-season add one of the GREATEST playoff chokers in modern NBA history. I'm just going to go through the individual games and you let me know if this is consistent play from a hall-of-fame player? \n\n2015 vs GSW (G5)\nJames Harden: 14 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists, 13 turnovers.\n\n2016 vs SA (G6)\nJames Harden: 10 points, 7 assists, 6 turnovers, 3 rebounds \n\n2022 vs MIA (G5)\nJames Harden: 14 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists, 4 turnovers\n\n2022 vs MIA (G6)\nJames Harden: 11 points, 9 assists, 4 turnovers \n\n2023 vs PHI (G6)\nJames Harden: 13 points, 9 assists, 7 rebounds, 5 turnovers, 4 stocks \n\n2023 vs PHI (G7)\nJames Harden: 9 points, 7 assists, 5 turnovers, 6 rebounds, 3 stocks \n\n2024 vs DAL (G5)\nJames Harden: 7 points, 7 assists, 4 turnovers, 4 rebounds \n\n2025 vs DEN (G5)\nJames Harden: 11 points, 8 rebounds, 5 assists, 4 turnovers \n\n2025 vs DEN (G7)\nJames Harden: 7 points, 13 assists, 5 rebounds, 2 turnovers \n\nI could go on and on, he's a playoff choker. It's not just him having bad performances, its the multiple times we've caught him checked out of a game and not playing any sort of defense to help his team get back. At-least Darius Garland would put in 110% effort on a bad shooting night. Also, defensively, we're still about the same as Harden. Yes, he's a dealing with a much more defensive team in the Cavs, who rely on their front-court to be the motor, and he's a bigger defensive side, but he's not the same age as some of our players, nor do I think he's going to bring the same effort on the court because of what he could bring offensively to the table, which is my next segway... \n\nOffensive Pace \nA big reason why the Cavaliers are so good offensively is due to their pace, and ability to get looks off of the transition with ease. Let's compare the offensive paces from our 2024-25 season to now, including the offensive pace for the Clippers with Harden as the offensive leader:\n\nCavs\n2024-25 season: \nPace: 99.8 (10th in NBA).\nOffensive Rating: 121.7 (1st in NBA).\nPoints Per Game: 121.9 (1st in NBA).\n\nCavs\n2025-26 season: \nPace: 101.1 (7th in NBA)\nOffensive Rating: 117.6 (9th in NBA)\nPoints Per Game: 119.3 (5th in NBA)\n\n-----\nClippers\n2024-25 season:\nPace: 97.5 (22nd in the NBA)\nOffensive Rating: 115.1 (14th in NBA)\nPoints: 112.9 (20th in NBA) \n\nClippers \n2025-26 season: \nPace: 95.9 (25th in the NBA)\nOffensive Rating: 116.8 (12th in NBA)\nPoints: 112.7 (25th in NBA)\n\nThe Clippers are an older roster, and do rely more on shot-making from Kawhi and Harden, so this makes sense, but the stark difference in pace and offensive rating, coupled with a 36-year old who's not going to be able to give 200% on both sides of the ball, probably makes our offensive pace slower, especially when Harden's out there with the second unit and Mitchell is benched. If we increase the pace, there's more risk of injury for older players, like Harden, Merrill, Strus, etc. In today's NBA, your conditioning needs to be spot on, and Harden has done a great job at that so far, but he's in a much more youthful team with a high pace, a likeliness for transition breakaways, and high energy plays. \n\nThere's no doubt that James Harden's shot-making and ability to space the floor will make us more efficient, but at the same time we're losing pace, which 9/10's going to bring our points down with him on the floor along with our pace. We have seen the Cavaliers go on streaks of slow offensive pace, and this could be the trade to try and accommodate Harden into our offense, rather them him accommodating into ours. Which brings me to my next point. \n\nJames Harden Himself \nI think this trade is showing that the front-office is probably going to get LeBron James to rejoin the Cavaliers in his 3rd stint and have his farewell tour. I don't mind it. I think LeBron James deserves that from us, but the cost remains to be seen. We're hoping he takes a paycut and does it out of love. Right now, from what I'm hearing, we're willing to give him his coveted 2-year, $80M deal, and all this hinges on the fact that we're able to make it to a finals appearance or win the championship in June. Because if we can't, Mitchell's probably declining his player-option and we're probably going to start rebuilding sooner than later. \n\nJames Harden is a very up-front person, but he's not a player we should trust, AT all.\n\n[Via New York Times]\nJames Harden wanted to retire with 76ers, but 'front office didn't have that in their future plans. \n\n[Via JoeyLin - Twitter]\n“Once I leave and retire from being a Clipper, hopefully that culture can continue leading to something special.”\n\nJames Harden wants to leave a legacy with the Clippers. He also hopes people can begin understanding who he really is.\n\nSimply put, he's not trustworthy, and if we're going to give him a $40M extension, and he's declining in production and age, we're not helping ourselves in freeing money from the books, or having cap space to build for the future. We own three second round picks in the next six years, and two first round picks in the next four years, which have a bunch of stipulations. \n\n2026 FRP: Less favorable of (i) less favorable of (a) CLE and (b) more favorable of UTH 1-8 and MIN [or (i) CLE if UTH not conveyable] and (ii) less favorable of ATL and SAN then more favorable of (i) and (ii) to ATL;\nmost / more favorable of CLE, MIN and UTH 1-8 to UTH\n(via UTH swap for MIN; via UTH swap of UTH or MIN for CLE; via SAN swap for ATL; via ATL swap of ATL or SAN for CLE, UTH or MIN)\n\n2028 FRP: Least favorable of CLE, UTH and ATL;\nmore favorable of CLE and UTH to UTH;\nmore favorable of (i) ATL and (ii) less favorable of CLE and UTH to ATL\n(via UTH swap for CLE; via ATL swap for CLE or UTH)\n\nMostly all of the picks have a lot of stipulations, which is going to be revealed in all due time. James Harden is simply here for the money and for himself, which credit to him, it's worked for majority of his career, but we shouldn't trust him, and we shouldn't go ALL-IN because we won't have a back-up plan and there's not going to be anyone to save us. \n\nDoes anyone remember the mood after LeBron James left in 2018? The roster was destroyed, left with old veterans who clearly didn't fit the timeline of his team and G-League players. We drafted Collin Sexton, which I'm forever grateful that he panned out. Darius Garland even started his Cavalier' career rough, missing a bunch of games to a knee injury and simply not being able to shoot the basketball. The front-office was able to hit on 2 out of the 3 picks, which is a miracle for a franchise who's had some blunders over the past years, with Anthony Bennett being the most notable out of all of them. James Harden knows how to control the offensive game of the pace, but his play-style isn't pretty, and it's going to make the game slow for the rest of our players, unless he's willing to buy in and change that. \n\nObviously, with Strus returning and Merrill getting more games under his belt, I think we're still going to be one of the best offenses in the league, but with majority of the team not performing to their standard in multiple games in the playoffs, coupled with a player you can't trust, a known playoff dropper, and a shooting guard who struggles to get out of the second round (whether it's his fault or not), it's going to be a miracle for this to be fixed, and it feels like we're asking for another disappointing season at this point. \n\nI'm pretty sure we're not done trading, but if the roster looks like this come playoff time, a lot of it is going to hinge on Mitchell being able to play off-ball with James Harden. With two players who love having the ball in their hands, this creates problems from us, especially in the offense. This will most likely have Mitchell and Harden split minutes to have their own run at the offense while they're in the game. James Harden is a pass-first player, but he needs the ball to really execute on that. Also, this forces Evan Mobley to probably be another wing player, as two big men nearing the same vicinity on the court only clog things up. Luckily, Evan's been developing a three-point shot, which is much needed for a 5-out. The Cavs attempt around 41 threes a game, which is in the top five. We also like to neglect the paint sometimes and shoot-chuck threes every while, which doesn't make sense to me. James Harden doesn’t spring us to championship contenders in my opinion, so where’s this going…\n\nI could talk about the fit, our issues with rebounding in the post-season, and our tendency to resort to iso ball in the post-season after spending a whole regular season dictating the offensive pace of games and ball-movement. I hate this trade for the Cavaliers, and for someone who's been a fan of this team, I'm willing to eat my words (literally I'll print out this post and eat it), if we win a championship. But unless our bench (the likes of Tyson, Merrill, Ellis, Schroder, Strus and Tomlin) have massive improvements in the post-season and can deliver timely plays, I don't see how this is going to work out, and I truly do fear the worst for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the next two years. I understand Darius Garland wasn't able to play, and that severely hampered our ability to win a championship, but putting all your chips on a 36-year old to suddenly have a change of heart and identity is not the way to do it, and you certainly don't panic now, you let it unravel in the off-season, or in the season prior. For a franchise to do this, I'm assuming Darius Garland is going to be out for the next 1 1/2 years on the Clippers, because that toe might need two plates in it when he's playing basketball. \n\nToodles.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qw212u", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Southern_Tackle_6754", "score": 0, "comments": 14, "created_utc": 1770241517.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770307462, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "27daf12ca25ed13e2a86e38728adc32327bc4c62", "source": "reddit", "title": "A Pacers Package for Giannis", "body": "I'm a Pacers fan, and I'm not sure I'd want this... but couldn't the Pacers put together one of the best trade packages for Giannis?\n\nObi Toppin\n\nAndrew Nembhard\n\nBen Mathurin\n\nJarace Walker\n\nIsaiah Jackson\n\nTheir 2026 pick\n\na few more picks\n\nThat's 3 young players that will likely get better, and Toppin who is a quality role player.

Is Cleveland just another example of teams putting too much weight on the current season production and not taking into account the variance in player production. \n\nClearly Harden has had a much better season to this date, but both Harden and Garland are pretty high variance players. Harden has been on a high and Garland has been low, but it really won't be that surprising to me if both players put up very similar production the rest of the year or if Garland is better in the second half of the season than Harden. \n\nHarden is also clearly at his best when he gets to be the first option. He seems to be the type of player that basically puts up the same efficiency regardless of how many shots he's taking. Honestly he might even be a player, who's efficiency goes up the more shots they take. I expect him to look worse playing second fiddle in Cleveland then he did as a first option for LAC.\n\nOverall this just seems really short-sighted by Cleveland. Harden is at the age where his production is likely to fall off a cliff at some point in the near future. That could be the second half of this season, more likely next season, almost guaranteed that his production falls off a cliff two seasons from now. Garland is 26, is having a very rough year, but just put up solid numbers last year and is likely to bounce back to form. maybe there are some medical issues with Garland that teams know about that I don't, that make this trade make more sense.\n\nMaybe Cleveland is a little bit closer to competing this year, but the long-term future just got a lot more bleak in my opinion. \n\nEdit: \n\nA lot of people seem to doubt that Garland was ever really that valuable of a player. Putting another reddit post down below that talks about Garlands value at his best.

All the while cashing in on a fever dream all time high valuation for DK. They do part with 2 unprotected firsts but its hard to believe that they will be in a good draft position with Luka having signed an extension.\n\nHell, all of the assets the lakers traded combined barely make a decent offer for just Luka, let alone a walking double double in Mark Williams and a valuable wing defender in DFS.

His teams were consistently top-heavy and lacking depth, which is the easiest way to catch criticism as a great #2 (like Blake) makes it much harder to attribute a playoff loss to “lack of help” than a well-constructed team without one. They also got injured at inopportune times, and the eventual conference winner pretty much always much better/deeper.\n\nLet’s go year-by-year and look who he lost to/the general West playoff landscape, and see if he could’ve been reasonably expected to win:\n\n‘08 Spurs - core of Duncan/Parker/Ginobili/Bowen/Finley. Chose ‘08 to not be accused of cherry-picking as they’re actually somewhat comparable here — Fin and Bowen were old, Barry and Horry were beyond washed. Nonetheless, CP3 still faced a supporting cast deficit and appropriately lost narrowly.\n\n‘09 Nuggets - Melo/still-prime Billups/Nene/Smith/Martin/Birdman/Kleiza had them clearly out-gunned, especially with Chandler’s injury.\n\n‘11 Lakers - laughable disparity. A rotation of Paul/Ariza/Belinelli/Okafor/Landry/Jack wasn’t gonna beat even a creaky Lakers team consisting of Kobe/Odom/Gasol/MWP/Fisher.\n\n‘12 Spurs - again just a ridiculous first round match-up. Paul-Griffin-Butler-Foye-young DAJ-young Bledsoe against Duncan/Parker/Ginobili/Green/Neal/Zygote Kawhi/Diaw/Splitter. If they beat them they’d have to face a much better Thunder team.\n\n‘13 Grizzlies - Paul/injured Blake/Barnes/Crawford/Bledsoe/pre-prime DAJ against Randolph/Conley/Gasol/Allen/Bayless/Prince and co. Not a total mismatch but we’re talking about an injured Clippers facing a 56 win team in the first round.\n\n‘14 Thunder - not a mismatch, Durant had a slightly better supporting cast, but still a roster deficit. The Spurs, of course, had a much deeper team.\n\n‘15 Rockets - not a mismatch, but Paul was injured. They lose in 7. They are likely not beating the Warriors even at full strength, and they beat a 55 win, defending champ Spurs team in the first round.\n\n‘16 Blazers - not a mismatch, CP3 has some culpability here, though again he was injured. Nonetheless, even if they won, they had the 73 win Warriors team awaiting them.\n\n‘17 Jazz - here Griffin was injured. Paul played very well but again drew a 50+ win team in the first round and again would’ve had to beat one of the best teams ever to even make the final.\n\nIn sum: even in early-round settings he usually faced a supporting cast deficit, with the team they lost to not even necessarily being the strongest team on offer, while having extremely poor injury luck in a historically stacked/lopsided conference.\n\nThere was never a year where they, even at full health, would’ve had a better supporting cast than the eventual conference winner. There was one when they were somewhat close (‘14), but still no cigar.\n\nNote: I am not a Paul fan, find him insufferable, and don’t regard him as a playoff riser by any means. But it sure does seem that, once you examine things year-by-year, it becomes difficult to pin their lack of playoff success squarely on his limitations as a #1 option. You put those same teams out East and it likely completely changes how the average fan sees him.

Do they envision that being their team for the next 2-4 years? A kind of 41-41 or 44-38 team? Or do they want a FRESH restart, with young guys and top picks?\n\nMIN - I cannot envision a world where the Timberwolves offer enough to get Giannis. They have no draft capital, which means they'd literally have to give up the house for him. That means giving up Jaden McDaniels, Naz Reid, Julius Randle and probably Rob Dillingham, and likely their 2026 Pick. Maybe that's enough, but that creates a similar situation as the Knicks. Does MIL want to become a 40-44 win team that just kind of \"hangs around\" in the 8-10th seeds, or do they want to start completely fresh?\n\nMIA - Again, yet another situation where it just feels like a meh kind of offer. Tyler Herro, sure he can score, but he's a huge liability on defense. Ware is nice. Jaquez Jr is a solid, if not unspectacular addition. But again, feels like a team that would go 35, maybe 40 wins. Herro is also super injury prone.\n\nGSW - They probably have the best shot out of the 4 teams that are heavily mentioned. Kuminga matches the \"young talent that can grow\" that MIL might want...Moody is interesting as a throw-in. Lets be honest though, Jimmy isn't going to stay there. He's old now, and will be coming off an ACL tear. Brandon Pod is another meh addition to me, not someone you build around. The picks are nice, and probably what sets them apart from the other teams...albeit they are unprotected.\n\n**In come the Thunder. The team that \"doesn't need him at all\"...but has the most to offer to get him.**\n\nI believe whole-heartedly that this is the time for Sam Presti to go all-in. SGA is still young and just started the beginning of his prime. And an addition of someone like Giannis would honestly be the second coming of Shaq and Kobe in my opinion. Obviously different players and different styles, but having SGA and Giannis on the same team feels almost like a cheat code. And I believe that there are multiple ways for them to make this splash happen.\n\n* **Option 1**: OKC offers Ajay Mitchell, Aaron Wiggins, and (3) 1st Round Picks. I fully believe that Ajay Mitchell is a star in the making, and could very easily be a 20-5-6 guy if he were ever a starting job with 34 MPG. Wiggins as well has excelled when given the opportunity. Both are young up-and-coming players, and I believe are players you can build around. Or at minimum, are players you can use to surround whoever your next \"star\" is. The 3 First Round Picks as well give the Bucks the opportunity for that \"big reset\" as well.\n* **Option 2**: Could OKC do something even crazier, and give up Jalen Williams? Now I love me some Jalen Williams, but the honest-to-god truth is that J-Dub is *always* injured. Aside from his rookie season, feels like he's always battling some kind of injury or coming in with a GTD tag for some kind of nagging injury. He missed 11 games in 2024. He missed 13 games in 2025. He's already missed 20+ games this season and we're only at the 48-game mark. Never a good sign when someone this young (24 years old) is already missing this many games early in their career. Could the front office get frisky and dangerous....and actually offer up a package of Jalen Williams, along with someone like Wiggins and say (2) 1st Round Picks? It's definitely a crazier take, but if I'm the front office, I'm looking at every avenue.\n\nFor me, this is an easy win for the OKC Thunder. You secure what will essentially be the future of your franchise. Pairing Giannis with SGA for what would likely be at least the next  5-8 years, and having a legit shot at not one, not two, but multiple championship runs.\n\n**SGA, Lu Dort, Jalen Williams, Giannis, and Chet** as your starting five.\n\nI-Hart, Caruso, Cason Wallace, Jaylin Williams and Isaiah Joe are your 5 off the bench.\n\nMake this make sense to me on how this scenario isn't going through Presti's mind.\n\nI'd love to hear the communities thoughts.\n\n**/TLDR** \\- Thunder could be looking like the next dynasty if they go in for Giannis.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qrwz0w", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "anasazigb", "score": 77, "comments": 70, "created_utc": 1769848234.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770307464, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "a55fc4778db814dfb04ead2324c3a7b4e6664ae8", "source": "reddit", "title": "In-Season Rules, FAQ, and Mega-Threads for NBAdiscussion", "body": "# The season is here!\n\nWhich means we will re-enact our in-season rules:\n\nPlayer comparison and ranking posts of any kind are not permitted. We will also limit trade proposals and free agent posts based on their quality, relevance, and how frequently reoccurring the topic may be.\n\nWe do not allow these kinds of posts for several reasons, including, but not limited to: they encourage low-effort replies, pit players against each other, skew readers towards an us-vs-them mentality that inevitably leads to brash hyperbole and insults.\n\n**What we want to see in our sub are well-considered analyses, well-supported opinions, and thoughtful replies that are open to listening to and learning from new perspectives.**\n\nWe grew significantly over the course of the last season. Please be familiar with our community[ and its rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/wiki/rules) before posting or commenting.\n\n# FAQ\n\n**We’d also like to address some common complaints we see in modmail:**\n\n* “*Why me and not them?*”\n   * We will not discuss other users with you.\n* “*The other person was way worse*.”\n   * Other people’s poor behavior does not excuse your own.\n* “*My post was removed for not promoting discussion but it had lots of comments*.”\n   * Incorrect: It was removed for not promoting **serious** discussion. It had comments but they were mostly low-quality. Or your post asked a straightforward question that can be answered in one word or sentence, or by Googling it. Try posting in our weekly questions thread instead.\n* *“My post met the requirements and is high quality but was still removed.*”\n   * Use in-depth arguments to support your opinion. Our sub is looking for posts that dig deeper than the minimum, examining the full context of a player or coach or team, how they changed, grew, and adjusted throughout their career, including the quality of their opponents and cultural impact of their celebrity; how they affected and improved their teammates, responded to coaches, what strategies they employed for different situations and challenges. Etc.\n* *“Why do posts/comments have a minimum character requirement? Why do you remove short posts and comments? Why don’t you let upvotes and downvotes decide?”*\n   * Our goal in this sub is to have a space for high-quality discussion. High-quality requires extra effort. Low-effort posts and comments are not only easier to write but to read, so even in a community where all the users are seeking high-quality, low-effort posts and comments will still garner more upvotes and more attention. If we allow low-effort posts and comments to remain, the community will gravitate towards them, pushing high-effort and high-quality posts and comments to the bottom. This encourages people to put in less effort. Removing them allows high-quality posts and comments to have space at the top, encouraging people to put in more effort in their own comments and posts.\n\nThere are still plenty of active NBA subs where users can enjoy making jokes or memes, or that welcome hot takes, and hyperbole (such as r/NBATalk, r/nbacirclejerk, or r/nba). Ours is not one of them.\n\n**We expect thoughtful, patient, and considerate interactions in our community.** Hopefully this is the reason you are here. If you are new, please take some time to read over our rules and observe, and we welcome you to participate and contribute to the quality of our sub too!\n\n**Discord Server:**\n\nWe have an active Discord server for anyone who wants to join! While the server follows most of the basic rules of this sub (eg. keep it civil), it offers a place for more casual, live discussions (featuring daily hoopgrids competition during the season), and we'd love to see more users getting involved over there as well.

To help prevent our community from being exhausted by new users starting the same debates and making the same arguments over and over, we will offer mega-threads throughout the off-season for the most popular topics.

But I see people either say he is an elite scorer and rising, or others say he is an inneficent complete ball stopper. So I wanted to explore a bit of whether Cam Thomas is an elite scorer or not.\n\nDisclaimer: I am a casual NBA fan, and I only watched 7-9 games of Cam Thomas, so this evaluation is extremely surface level.\n\nTo me, Cam Thomas isn't an elite scorer, he's a great shot maker, meaning he can make almost any kind of shot out there and it has a chance of going in The reason why I don't believe he is an elite scorer is that, to me, elite scorers have many different counters and answers to different defensive looks and sort of have a conceptual flow chart when they have the ball in their hand and can use athletic or fundamental advantages to get easier shots. And as a result, they can force the defense to adjust to them. For example, people like Kobe or SGA have several different answers to a multitude of defensive situations and counters within counters for the defense, while keeping things simple and leaning into tougher shots later in the shot clock or in the game when their teams need it.\n\nWhen I look at Cam Thomas, he can hit tough shots and get hot instantly, but his scoring ability is more limited due to his physicals and his height. He can get to his spots like the elbow or the key, but he has to work hard in order to get there and expend more energy than other scorers. And he doesn't have effective counters to what the defense is doing. As a result of this, he isn't great at generating space, and he tries beat the defense with his shotmaking ability, which leads to more difficult shots and less efficiency.  [Example 1](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;GameID=0022500704&amp;PlayerID=1630560&amp;Season=2025-26&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=&amp;flag=3&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game), [Example 2](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;GameID=0022500694&amp;PlayerID=1630560&amp;Season=2025-26&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=&amp;flag=3&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game).\n\nFor example, outside of shooting or driving, when he is open, if he can't drive to the basket, he would either step back for a mid-range get to the key for a floater/pull-up shot, or go all the way to the basket for a layup. He has more options/ reads than im giving him credit for when it comes to scoring, but my point is that his options are either not available or not effective once the inital reads are taken away.\n\nHe also doesn't have great size, elite handles, great shooting, or rim gravity, so he has to work extra hard just to create shots himself. He isn't much of a threat to defenses and they can defend these options without worrying about effective counters so as a result he can get easy buckets vs bad defenders or small defenders and can score well early in a season but once teams scout him or get closer to the playoffs the difficulty of his shots go up exponentially where his shot difficulty can be a 5-6/10 to a 8/9/10 which he can hit but not at enough of a rate for the shot to be effiecent in the first place. \n\nWhere Cam Thomas is at his best, in my opinion, is in early offense or transition and off the ball. Where he can start off with an advantage, where he can simplify his game, get to his spots easier, and reduce the difficulty of his shots, although his ceiling on these looks is not high especially this season, the efficiency for these looks has been lower than in 2023-24 and 24-25 [Cam Thomas | Guard | Brooklyn Nets | NBA.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1630560/shots-dash).\n\nI don’t believe that Cam Thomas is a ball hog. In my opinion hes a willing passer, but he isn't consistently good at more complex reads, and since he's on a bad team, he needs to get something going for the offense, and this means that his shot selection can be wild at times in order to generate offense.\n\nAs a result of this, I don't think he is an elite scorer, he just doesn't have the tools that guys like Booker, SGA, Kobe, or Ant have to keep the defense on its heels. To me hes a microwave scorer and an elite shotmaker. He is sort of like a quarterback who thrives off one read, but when that read is taken away or limited, his efficiency goes down.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qx2c0f", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Comer_Agua", "score": 20, "comments": 56, "created_utc": 1770336769.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770361964, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "7c00f9d4ed9a591ce862ad2de231028e8e98bf76", "source": "reddit", "title": "Trust Danny Ainge?", "body": "Danny Ainge probably has one of the better GM track records in the NBA over the course of his career, but I have doubts about his recent trade for Jaren Jackson Jr and at the very least it does not seem like a sure fire win.\n\nJJJ's traditional stats the past few years do not jump off the page, but EPM has usually rated him as an elite player (top 20-30 player in the league), due to his defense. To me I just don't really understand if a player like JJJ is worth his contract of $50 million a year, but apparently to Danny Ainge he is worth his contract plus about 4 first round picks (probably 3 mid to low picks and I would bet on the Phoenix pick being a very good pick, but very far away).\n\nOn top of this I don't really understand the fit of needing to play JJJ at center most of the time. I know the NBA is moving in the direction of having smaller centers that can shoot, but I think Utah will still have quite a few match up problems. Maybe this is not as big of an issue as I am thinking. Maybe Utah will have so much shooting and spacing that other teams will have to adjust to them.\n\nOverall, this seemed like an overpay to me for JJJ and I'm surprised Memphis was able to get this much for him. Part of me though still trusts Danny Ainge and if he thinks JJJ can be a top 20 player in the league for years to come than maybe this makes sense.\n\n**Edit:**\n\n**Just remembered that it is his son running the show in Utah now, so not sure I have much trust :)** **I would guess that Danny is still pulling the strings a lot in Utah.**", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qwqb0p", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Advanced-Turn-6878", "score": 0, "comments": 32, "created_utc": 1770309792.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770361965, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "a321b1492a118717f127fb32ad993976de7e7333", "source": "reddit", "title": "Bulls Back Office: Trade Deadline Report - Acquire Day'Ron Sharpe", "body": "**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**  \n*From the Desk of the Intern*\n\n### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nPer directive from the _Señor Director_, I have been tasked with conducting reconnaissance on available centers at the trade deadline. What I discovered requires immediate escalation to leadership.\n\n**The situation:** The Brooklyn Nets are running the most sophisticated trade value manipulation scheme I have seen in my brief, unqualified tenure in speculative basketball operations.\n\n**The target:** [Day'Ron Sharpe](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/sharpda01.html), a 24-year-old backup center making $6.2 million annually.\n\n**The con:** Brooklyn is suppressing Sharpe's minutes while showcasing [Nic Claxton](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/claxtni01.html) ($97M/4yr) to inflate trade value, despite Sharpe posting _superior performance metrics_.\n\n**Bottom line:** The Nets are soft-tanking, while selling fool's gold (Claxton) and hiding actual gold (Sharpe).\n\n### SITUATION REPORT\n\n#### The Performance Gap\n\nI reviewed the [Nets' 2025-26 three-man lineup data](https://www.nba.com/stats/lineups/advanced?CF=MIN*GE*30&amp;GroupQuantity=3&amp;TeamID=1610612751&amp;dir=A&amp;slug=advanced&amp;sort=DEF_RATING). The findings are, to use technical basketball operations terminology, _\"fucking bonkers.\"_\n\n**Sharpe's Best Defensive Lineups:**\n\n- Sharpe + Williams + Saraf: 79.8 DefRtg (44 minutes)\n- Sharpe + Mann + Williams: 82.6 DefRtg (32 minutes)  \n- Sharpe + Wilson + Wolf: 85.6 DefRtg (59 minutes)\n\n**Claxton's \"Defensive Anchor\" Lineups:**\n\n- Claxton + Clowney + Traore: 98.3 DefRtg (55 minutes)\n- Claxton + Porter + Wolf: 99.2 DefRtg (58 minutes)\n- Most Claxton lineups: 100+ DefRtg \n\n\n#### The Offensive Surprise\n\nThe conventional wisdom suggests Claxton is the more polished offensive player. The lineup data suggests conventional wisdom should—at its earliest convenience—kindly go fuck itself.\n\n- **Porter + Sharpe + Clowney:** 130.7 OffRtg  \n- **Porter + Claxton + Clowney:** 113.2 OffRtg\n\n- **Porter + Mann + Sharpe:** 141.1 OffRtg (35.8 NetRtg)  \n- **Porter + Mann + Claxton:** 112.8 OffRtg (-5.1 NetRtg)\n\nI'm no mathematician (_420 SAT math_), but these numbers represent _\"a significant difference?\"_\n\n#### The Minutes Conspiracy\n\nYes, the sample sizes are small. That isn’t an accident; it’s the strategy. This is why the Nets’ plan is so cunning. Here is where the operation becomes transparent:\n\nSharpe's best-performing lineups are receiving drastically fewer minutes than Claxton's inferior lineups. This is not coaching incompetence—Jordi Fernández is smarter than that. This is *deliberate roster management*.\n\n**The Nets' Strategy (Decoded):**\n\n1. Showcase Claxton to contenders (Warriors, Pacers) as \"defensive anchor\"\n2. Let him accumulate starter minutes despite worse performance\n3.

He's the reason why we're able to contend, I'll never forget him and his 2022 days. Now, let's get started:\n\nThe Age Gap\nThe first thing I immediately noticed once this rumored trade was spread around my time-line is the age gap. We're lucky James Harden hasn't sustained a major career injury since 2021, because this would've looked like a really bad trade. James is 36, and Darius is 26, a 10-year age gap. Our next oldest player is Larry Nance Jr at 33, and Dennis Schroder at 32. The combined age for this roster is now 27, so we're getting older and closer to win now mode, which leads to my second problem: \n\n*\"Win-Now Mode\"\nI heard from multiple Cavs fans that James Harden is a \"proven winner.\" I genuinely can't believe that comes out of some people's mouths, but even if he is, we're hinging on the fact that it's championship or bust for the next two seasons, meaning Mobley and Allen cannot fail to fuck up. Once you're not able to win during a window, you NEED to have a back-up plan, regardless. With LeBron James rumored to come back to Cleveland for one more season, the memories will be there, but it's important to know what our future looks like after Harden and LeBron, and right now, all of the front-offices chips seem to be put on Jaylon Tyson and Evan Mobley to lead the future of this team. Depending on the playoff results, that picture may or may not include Donovan Mitchell. \n\nPlayoff Choker \nThe biggest one of them all in my opinion. How can a team, who's looking to get over the hump, who's known for choking in the post-season add one of the GREATEST playoff chokers in modern NBA history. I'm just going to go through the individual games and you let me know if this is consistent play from a hall-of-fame player? \n\n2015 vs GSW (G5)\nJames Harden: 14 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists, 13 turnovers.\n\n2016 vs SA (G6)\nJames Harden: 10 points, 7 assists, 6 turnovers, 3 rebounds \n\n2022 vs MIA (G5)\nJames Harden: 14 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists, 4 turnovers\n\n2022 vs MIA (G6)\nJames Harden: 11 points, 9 assists, 4 turnovers \n\n2023 vs PHI (G6)\nJames Harden: 13 points, 9 assists, 7 rebounds, 5 turnovers, 4 stocks \n\n2023 vs PHI (G7)\nJames Harden: 9 points, 7 assists, 5 turnovers, 6 rebounds, 3 stocks \n\n2024 vs DAL (G5)\nJames Harden: 7 points, 7 assists, 4 turnovers, 4 rebounds \n\n2025 vs DEN (G5)\nJames Harden: 11 points, 8 rebounds, 5 assists, 4 turnovers \n\n2025 vs DEN (G7)\nJames Harden: 7 points, 13 assists, 5 rebounds, 2 turnovers \n\nI could go on and on, he's a playoff choker. It's not just him having bad performances, its the multiple times we've caught him checked out of a game and not playing any sort of defense to help his team get back. At-least Darius Garland would put in 110% effort on a bad shooting night. Also, defensively, we're still about the same as Harden. Yes, he's a dealing with a much more defensive team in the Cavs, who rely on their front-court to be the motor, and he's a bigger defensive side, but he's not the same age as some of our players, nor do I think he's going to bring the same effort on the court because of what he could bring offensively to the table, which is my next segway... \n\nOffensive Pace \nA big reason why the Cavaliers are so good offensively is due to their pace, and ability to get looks off of the transition with ease. Let's compare the offensive paces from our 2024-25 season to now, including the offensive pace for the Clippers with Harden as the offensive leader:\n\nCavs\n2024-25 season: \nPace: 99.8 (10th in NBA).\nOffensive Rating: 121.7 (1st in NBA).\nPoints Per Game: 121.9 (1st in NBA).\n\nCavs\n2025-26 season: \nPace: 101.1 (7th in NBA)\nOffensive Rating: 117.6 (9th in NBA)\nPoints Per Game: 119.3 (5th in NBA)\n\n-----\nClippers\n2024-25 season:\nPace: 97.5 (22nd in the NBA)\nOffensive Rating: 115.1 (14th in NBA)\nPoints: 112.9 (20th in NBA) \n\nClippers \n2025-26 season: \nPace: 95.9 (25th in the NBA)\nOffensive Rating: 116.8 (12th in NBA)\nPoints: 112.7 (25th in NBA)\n\nThe Clippers are an older roster, and do rely more on shot-making from Kawhi and Harden, so this makes sense, but the stark difference in pace and offensive rating, coupled with a 36-year old who's not going to be able to give 200% on both sides of the ball, probably makes our offensive pace slower, especially when Harden's out there with the second unit and Mitchell is benched. If we increase the pace, there's more risk of injury for older players, like Harden, Merrill, Strus, etc. In today's NBA, your conditioning needs to be spot on, and Harden has done a great job at that so far, but he's in a much more youthful team with a high pace, a likeliness for transition breakaways, and high energy plays. \n\nThere's no doubt that James Harden's shot-making and ability to space the floor will make us more efficient, but at the same time we're losing pace, which 9/10's going to bring our points down with him on the floor along with our pace. We have seen the Cavaliers go on streaks of slow offensive pace, and this could be the trade to try and accommodate Harden into our offense, rather them him accommodating into ours. Which brings me to my next point. \n\nJames Harden Himself \nI think this trade is showing that the front-office is probably going to get LeBron James to rejoin the Cavaliers in his 3rd stint and have his farewell tour. I don't mind it. I think LeBron James deserves that from us, but the cost remains to be seen. We're hoping he takes a paycut and does it out of love. Right now, from what I'm hearing, we're willing to give him his coveted 2-year, $80M deal, and all this hinges on the fact that we're able to make it to a finals appearance or win the championship in June. Because if we can't, Mitchell's probably declining his player-option and we're probably going to start rebuilding sooner than later. \n\nJames Harden is a very up-front person, but he's not a player we should trust, AT all.\n\n[Via New York Times]\nJames Harden wanted to retire with 76ers, but 'front office didn't have that in their future plans. \n\n[Via JoeyLin - Twitter]\n“Once I leave and retire from being a Clipper, hopefully that culture can continue leading to something special.”\n\nJames Harden wants to leave a legacy with the Clippers. He also hopes people can begin understanding who he really is.\n\nSimply put, he's not trustworthy, and if we're going to give him a $40M extension, and he's declining in production and age, we're not helping ourselves in freeing money from the books, or having cap space to build for the future. We own three second round picks in the next six years, and two first round picks in the next four years, which have a bunch of stipulations. \n\n2026 FRP: Less favorable of (i) less favorable of (a) CLE and (b) more favorable of UTH 1-8 and MIN [or (i) CLE if UTH not conveyable] and (ii) less favorable of ATL and SAN then more favorable of (i) and (ii) to ATL;\nmost / more favorable of CLE, MIN and UTH 1-8 to UTH\n(via UTH swap for MIN; via UTH swap of UTH or MIN for CLE; via SAN swap for ATL; via ATL swap of ATL or SAN for CLE, UTH or MIN)\n\n2028 FRP: Least favorable of CLE, UTH and ATL;\nmore favorable of CLE and UTH to UTH;\nmore favorable of (i) ATL and (ii) less favorable of CLE and UTH to ATL\n(via UTH swap for CLE; via ATL swap for CLE or UTH)\n\nMostly all of the picks have a lot of stipulations, which is going to be revealed in all due time. James Harden is simply here for the money and for himself, which credit to him, it's worked for majority of his career, but we shouldn't trust him, and we shouldn't go ALL-IN because we won't have a back-up plan and there's not going to be anyone to save us. \n\nDoes anyone remember the mood after LeBron James left in 2018? The roster was destroyed, left with old veterans who clearly didn't fit the timeline of his team and G-League players. We drafted Collin Sexton, which I'm forever grateful that he panned out. Darius Garland even started his Cavalier' career rough, missing a bunch of games to a knee injury and simply not being able to shoot the basketball. The front-office was able to hit on 2 out of the 3 picks, which is a miracle for a franchise who's had some blunders over the past years, with Anthony Bennett being the most notable out of all of them. James Harden knows how to control the offensive game of the pace, but his play-style isn't pretty, and it's going to make the game slow for the rest of our players, unless he's willing to buy in and change that. \n\nObviously, with Strus returning and Merrill getting more games under his belt, I think we're still going to be one of the best offenses in the league, but with majority of the team not performing to their standard in multiple games in the playoffs, coupled with a player you can't trust, a known playoff dropper, and a shooting guard who struggles to get out of the second round (whether it's his fault or not), it's going to be a miracle for this to be fixed, and it feels like we're asking for another disappointing season at this point. \n\nI'm pretty sure we're not done trading, but if the roster looks like this come playoff time, a lot of it is going to hinge on Mitchell being able to play off-ball with James Harden. With two players who love having the ball in their hands, this creates problems from us, especially in the offense. This will most likely have Mitchell and Harden split minutes to have their own run at the offense while they're in the game. James Harden is a pass-first player, but he needs the ball to really execute on that. Also, this forces Evan Mobley to probably be another wing player, as two big men nearing the same vicinity on the court only clog things up. Luckily, Evan's been developing a three-point shot, which is much needed for a 5-out. The Cavs attempt around 41 threes a game, which is in the top five. We also like to neglect the paint sometimes and shoot-chuck threes every while, which doesn't make sense to me. James Harden doesn’t spring us to championship contenders in my opinion, so where’s this going…\n\nI could talk about the fit, our issues with rebounding in the post-season, and our tendency to resort to iso ball in the post-season after spending a whole regular season dictating the offensive pace of games and ball-movement. I hate this trade for the Cavaliers, and for someone who's been a fan of this team, I'm willing to eat my words (literally I'll print out this post and eat it), if we win a championship. But unless our bench (the likes of Tyson, Merrill, Ellis, Schroder, Strus and Tomlin) have massive improvements in the post-season and can deliver timely plays, I don't see how this is going to work out, and I truly do fear the worst for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the next two years. I understand Darius Garland wasn't able to play, and that severely hampered our ability to win a championship, but putting all your chips on a 36-year old to suddenly have a change of heart and identity is not the way to do it, and you certainly don't panic now, you let it unravel in the off-season, or in the season prior. For a franchise to do this, I'm assuming Darius Garland is going to be out for the next 1 1/2 years on the Clippers, because that toe might need two plates in it when he's playing basketball. \n\nToodles.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qw212u", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Southern_Tackle_6754", "score": 0, "comments": 15, "created_utc": 1770241517.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770361965, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "604943dc17f6f3229c215031e13e3833c552d91d", "source": "reddit", "title": "A Pacers Package for Giannis", "body": "I'm a Pacers fan, and I'm not sure I'd want this... but couldn't the Pacers put together one of the best trade packages for Giannis?\n\nObi Toppin\n\nAndrew Nembhard\n\nBen Mathurin\n\nJarace Walker\n\nIsaiah Jackson\n\nTheir 2026 pick\n\na few more picks\n\nThat's 3 young players that will likely get better, and Toppin who is a quality role player.

Is Cleveland just another example of teams putting too much weight on the current season production and not taking into account the variance in player production. \n\nClearly Harden has had a much better season to this date, but both Harden and Garland are pretty high variance players. Harden has been on a high and Garland has been low, but it really won't be that surprising to me if both players put up very similar production the rest of the year or if Garland is better in the second half of the season than Harden. \n\nHarden is also clearly at his best when he gets to be the first option. He seems to be the type of player that basically puts up the same efficiency regardless of how many shots he's taking. Honestly he might even be a player, who's efficiency goes up the more shots they take. I expect him to look worse playing second fiddle in Cleveland then he did as a first option for LAC.\n\nOverall this just seems really short-sighted by Cleveland. Harden is at the age where his production is likely to fall off a cliff at some point in the near future. That could be the second half of this season, more likely next season, almost guaranteed that his production falls off a cliff two seasons from now. Garland is 26, is having a very rough year, but just put up solid numbers last year and is likely to bounce back to form. maybe there are some medical issues with Garland that teams know about that I don't, that make this trade make more sense.\n\nMaybe Cleveland is a little bit closer to competing this year, but the long-term future just got a lot more bleak in my opinion. \n\nEdit: \n\nA lot of people seem to doubt that Garland was ever really that valuable of a player. Putting another reddit post down below that talks about Garlands value at his best. I personally think this is just a down year, but maybe I'm not aware that his injuries make him unlikely to ever be good again. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1cufr6k/how_good_is_darius_garland_for_those_interested/?utm_source=chatgpt.com", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qvpm1f", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Advanced-Turn-6878", "score": 130, "comments": 126, "created_utc": 1770214371.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770361965, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "6c79ede1ce4864e3773804dbd9b475d947e1fb3c", "source": "reddit", "title": "What is the deal with Lebron?", "body": "As a player he seems incredible watched a video where he gers compared to MJ and he's almost as good as him and seems to be one of the best players in the league at his prime and one of the best players all around.

His teams were consistently top-heavy and lacking depth, which is the easiest way to catch criticism as a great #2 (like Blake) makes it much harder to attribute a playoff loss to “lack of help” than a well-constructed team without one. They also got injured at inopportune times, and the eventual conference winner pretty much always much better/deeper.\n\nLet’s go year-by-year and look who he lost to/the general West playoff landscape, and see if he could’ve been reasonably expected to win:\n\n‘08 Spurs - core of Duncan/Parker/Ginobili/Bowen/Finley. Chose ‘08 to not be accused of cherry-picking as they’re actually somewhat comparable here — Fin and Bowen were old, Barry and Horry were beyond washed. Nonetheless, CP3 still faced a supporting cast deficit and appropriately lost narrowly.\n\n‘09 Nuggets - Melo/still-prime Billups/Nene/Smith/Martin/Birdman/Kleiza had them clearly out-gunned, especially with Chandler’s injury.\n\n‘11 Lakers - laughable disparity. A rotation of Paul/Ariza/Belinelli/Okafor/Landry/Jack wasn’t gonna beat even a creaky Lakers team consisting of Kobe/Odom/Gasol/MWP/Fisher.\n\n‘12 Spurs - again just a ridiculous first round match-up. Paul-Griffin-Butler-Foye-young DAJ-young Bledsoe against Duncan/Parker/Ginobili/Green/Neal/Zygote Kawhi/Diaw/Splitter. If they beat them they’d have to face a much better Thunder team.\n\n‘13 Grizzlies - Paul/injured Blake/Barnes/Crawford/Bledsoe/pre-prime DAJ against Randolph/Conley/Gasol/Allen/Bayless/Prince and co. Not a total mismatch but we’re talking about an injured Clippers facing a 56 win team in the first round.\n\n‘14 Thunder - not a mismatch, Durant had a slightly better supporting cast, but still a roster deficit. The Spurs, of course, had a much deeper team.\n\n‘15 Rockets - not a mismatch, but Paul was injured. They lose in 7. They are likely not beating the Warriors even at full strength, and they beat a 55 win, defending champ Spurs team in the first round.\n\n‘16 Blazers - not a mismatch, CP3 has some culpability here, though again he was injured. Nonetheless, even if they won, they had the 73 win Warriors team awaiting them.\n\n‘17 Jazz - here Griffin was injured. Paul played very well but again drew a 50+ win team in the first round and again would’ve had to beat one of the best teams ever to even make the final.\n\nIn sum: even in early-round settings he usually faced a supporting cast deficit, with the team they lost to not even necessarily being the strongest team on offer, while having extremely poor injury luck in a historically stacked/lopsided conference.\n\nThere was never a year where they, even at full health, would’ve had a better supporting cast than the eventual conference winner. There was one when they were somewhat close (‘14), but still no cigar.\n\nNote: I am not a Paul fan, find him insufferable, and don’t regard him as a playoff riser by any means. But it sure does seem that, once you examine things year-by-year, it becomes difficult to pin their lack of playoff success squarely on his limitations as a #1 option. You put those same teams out East and it likely completely changes how the average fan sees him.

We will also limit trade proposals and free agent posts based on their quality, relevance, and how frequently reoccurring the topic may be.\n\nWe do not allow these kinds of posts for several reasons, including, but not limited to: they encourage low-effort replies, pit players against each other, skew readers towards an us-vs-them mentality that inevitably leads to brash hyperbole and insults.\n\n**What we want to see in our sub are well-considered analyses, well-supported opinions, and thoughtful replies that are open to listening to and learning from new perspectives.**\n\nWe grew significantly over the course of the last season. Please be familiar with our community[ and its rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/wiki/rules) before posting or commenting.\n\n# FAQ\n\n**We’d also like to address some common complaints we see in modmail:**\n\n* “*Why me and not them?*”\n   * We will not discuss other users with you.\n* “*The other person was way worse*.”\n   * Other people’s poor behavior does not excuse your own.\n* “*My post was removed for not promoting discussion but it had lots of comments*.”\n   * Incorrect: It was removed for not promoting **serious** discussion. It had comments but they were mostly low-quality. Or your post asked a straightforward question that can be answered in one word or sentence, or by Googling it. Try posting in our weekly questions thread instead.\n* *“My post met the requirements and is high quality but was still removed.*”\n   * Use in-depth arguments to support your opinion. Our sub is looking for posts that dig deeper than the minimum, examining the full context of a player or coach or team, how they changed, grew, and adjusted throughout their career, including the quality of their opponents and cultural impact of their celebrity; how they affected and improved their teammates, responded to coaches, what strategies they employed for different situations and challenges. Etc.\n* *“Why do posts/comments have a minimum character requirement? Why do you remove short posts and comments? Why don’t you let upvotes and downvotes decide?”*\n   * Our goal in this sub is to have a space for high-quality discussion. High-quality requires extra effort. Low-effort posts and comments are not only easier to write but to read, so even in a community where all the users are seeking high-quality, low-effort posts and comments will still garner more upvotes and more attention. If we allow low-effort posts and comments to remain, the community will gravitate towards them, pushing high-effort and high-quality posts and comments to the bottom. This encourages people to put in less effort. Removing them allows high-quality posts and comments to have space at the top, encouraging people to put in more effort in their own comments and posts.\n\nThere are still plenty of active NBA subs where users can enjoy making jokes or memes, or that welcome hot takes, and hyperbole (such as r/NBATalk, r/nbacirclejerk, or r/nba). Ours is not one of them.\n\n**We expect thoughtful, patient, and considerate interactions in our community.** Hopefully this is the reason you are here. If you are new, please take some time to read over our rules and observe, and we welcome you to participate and contribute to the quality of our sub too!\n\n**Discord Server:**\n\nWe have an active Discord server for anyone who wants to join! While the server follows most of the basic rules of this sub (eg. keep it civil), it offers a place for more casual, live discussions (featuring daily hoopgrids competition during the season), and we'd love to see more users getting involved over there as well. It includes channels for various topics such as game-threads for the new season, all-time discussions, analysis and draft/college discussions, as well as other sports such as NFL/college football and baseball.\n\nLink:[ https://discord.gg/8mJYhrT5VZ](https://discord.gg/8mJYhrT5VZ) (let u/roundrajaon34 or other mods know if there are any issues with this link)\n\n**Mega-Threads**\n\nWe see a lot of re-hashing of the same topics over and over again. To help prevent our community from being exhausted by new users starting the same debates and making the same arguments over and over, we will offer mega-threads throughout the off-season for the most popular topics. We will add links to these threads under this post over time.

The chance at a #1 pick basically incentivizes every team to be as worse as possible. Let's look at the current tankathon.com rankings and the teams that own their own picks and might tank:   \n\n\n1: Sacramento: Obviously they would still tank if there's no lottery.  \n\n3. Indiana: I don't think Indiana wants to tank and I don't think getting rid of the lottery would change anything.    \n\n4. Brooklyn: They would continue to tank in either system.    \n\n5-6: Was, Utah: Both teams need to keep their pick, so they would tank in either system. However, because the lottery potentially drops their ranking, it encourages them to be worse than just 8.    \n\n7-9: Dallas, Memphis, Milwaukee: I think without a lottery system, these teams would not have any chance to break into the top 4. I don't think tanking for positioning between picks 7-11 is worth it. I think they'd compete harder if there was no lottery.   \n\n12-13: Chicago, Charlotte: Being in the lottery gives these teams incentive to stay there. No lottery would limit tanking.     \n\n15. Miami: Again, depending on how things go, they might.  benefit from breaking into the lottery and getting a chance at a top 4 pick. No lottery discourages tanking.    \n\n\nAs you can see, a no lottery system doesn't really affect the most egregious tankers, but it does limit tanking for teams in the 5-15 range. This pretty much mirrors what we see in the NFL.

But I see people either say he is an elite scorer and rising, or others say he is an inneficent complete ball stopper. So I wanted to explore a bit of whether Cam Thomas is an elite scorer or not.\n\nDisclaimer: I am a casual NBA fan, and I only watched 7-9 games of Cam Thomas, so this evaluation is extremely surface level.\n\nTo me, Cam Thomas isn't an elite scorer, he's a great shot maker, meaning he can make almost any kind of shot out there and it has a chance of going in The reason why I don't believe he is an elite scorer is that, to me, elite scorers have many different counters and answers to different defensive looks and sort of have a conceptual flow chart when they have the ball in their hand and can use athletic or fundamental advantages to get easier shots. And as a result, they can force the defense to adjust to them. For example, people like Kobe or SGA have several different answers to a multitude of defensive situations and counters within counters for the defense, while keeping things simple and leaning into tougher shots later in the shot clock or in the game when their teams need it.\n\nWhen I look at Cam Thomas, he can hit tough shots and get hot instantly, but his scoring ability is more limited due to his physicals and his height. He can get to his spots like the elbow or the key, but he has to work hard in order to get there and expend more energy than other scorers. And he doesn't have effective counters to what the defense is doing. As a result of this, he isn't great at generating space, and he tries beat the defense with his shotmaking ability, which leads to more difficult shots and less efficiency.  [Example 1](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;GameID=0022500704&amp;PlayerID=1630560&amp;Season=2025-26&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=&amp;flag=3&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game), [Example 2](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;GameID=0022500694&amp;PlayerID=1630560&amp;Season=2025-26&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=&amp;flag=3&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game).\n\nFor example, outside of shooting or driving, when he is open, if he can't drive to the basket, he would either step back for a mid-range get to the key for a floater/pull-up shot, or go all the way to the basket for a layup. He has more options/ reads than im giving him credit for when it comes to scoring, but my point is that his options are either not available or not effective once the inital reads are taken away.\n\nHe also doesn't have great size, elite handles, great shooting, or rim gravity, so he has to work extra hard just to create shots himself. He isn't much of a threat to defenses and they can defend these options without worrying about effective counters so as a result he can get easy buckets vs bad defenders or small defenders and can score well early in a season but once teams scout him or get closer to the playoffs the difficulty of his shots go up exponentially where his shot difficulty can be a 5-6/10 to a 8/9/10 which he can hit but not at enough of a rate for the shot to be effiecent in the first place. \n\nWhere Cam Thomas is at his best, in my opinion, is in early offense or transition and off the ball. Where he can start off with an advantage, where he can simplify his game, get to his spots easier, and reduce the difficulty of his shots, although his ceiling on these looks is not high especially this season, the efficiency for these looks has been lower than in 2023-24 and 24-25 [Cam Thomas | Guard | Brooklyn Nets | NBA.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1630560/shots-dash).\n\nI don’t believe that Cam Thomas is a ball hog. In my opinion hes a willing passer, but he isn't consistently good at more complex reads, and since he's on a bad team, he needs to get something going for the offense, and this means that his shot selection can be wild at times in order to generate offense.\n\nAs a result of this, I don't think he is an elite scorer, he just doesn't have the tools that guys like Booker, SGA, Kobe, or Ant have to keep the defense on its heels. To me hes a microwave scorer and an elite shotmaker. He is sort of like a quarterback who thrives off one read, but when that read is taken away or limited, his efficiency goes down.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qx2c0f", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Comer_Agua", "score": 65, "comments": 83, "created_utc": 1770336769.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770480369, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "d38728f91914be76868c3effa6e9e0c5367c447b", "source": "reddit", "title": "Trust Danny Ainge?", "body": "Danny Ainge probably has one of the better GM track records in the NBA over the course of his career, but I have doubts about his recent trade for Jaren Jackson Jr and at the very least it does not seem like a sure fire win.\n\nJJJ's traditional stats the past few years do not jump off the page, but EPM has usually rated him as an elite player (top 20-30 player in the league), due to his defense. To me I just don't really understand if a player like JJJ is worth his contract of $50 million a year, but apparently to Danny Ainge he is worth his contract plus about 4 first round picks (probably 3 mid to low picks and I would bet on the Phoenix pick being a very good pick, but very far away).\n\nOn top of this I don't really understand the fit of needing to play JJJ at center most of the time. I know the NBA is moving in the direction of having smaller centers that can shoot, but I think Utah will still have quite a few match up problems. Maybe this is not as big of an issue as I am thinking. Maybe Utah will have so much shooting and spacing that other teams will have to adjust to them.\n\nOverall, this seemed like an overpay to me for JJJ and I'm surprised Memphis was able to get this much for him. Part of me though still trusts Danny Ainge and if he thinks JJJ can be a top 20 player in the league for years to come than maybe this makes sense.\n\n**Edit:**\n\n**Just remembered that it is his son running the show in Utah now, so not sure I have much trust :)** **I would guess that Danny is still pulling the strings a lot in Utah.**", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qwqb0p", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Advanced-Turn-6878", "score": 0, "comments": 32, "created_utc": 1770309792.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770480369, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "2b6eda063f64ef6c1c66efff3cd8402b411073c2", "source": "reddit", "title": "This has the potential to be one of the worst trades in Cavs' history", "body": "First and foremost, I wish the best of luck to Darius Garland. He's the reason why we're able to contend, I'll never forget him and his 2022 days. Now, let's get started:\n\nThe Age Gap\nThe first thing I immediately noticed once this rumored trade was spread around my time-line is the age gap. We're lucky James Harden hasn't sustained a major career injury since 2021, because this would've looked like a really bad trade. James is 36, and Darius is 26, a 10-year age gap. Our next oldest player is Larry Nance Jr at 33, and Dennis Schroder at 32. The combined age for this roster is now 27, so we're getting older and closer to win now mode, which leads to my second problem: \n\n*\"Win-Now Mode\"\nI heard from multiple Cavs fans that James Harden is a \"proven winner.\" I genuinely can't believe that comes out of some people's mouths, but even if he is, we're hinging on the fact that it's championship or bust for the next two seasons, meaning Mobley and Allen cannot fail to fuck up. Once you're not able to win during a window, you NEED to have a back-up plan, regardless. With LeBron James rumored to come back to Cleveland for one more season, the memories will be there, but it's important to know what our future looks like after Harden and LeBron, and right now, all of the front-offices chips seem to be put on Jaylon Tyson and Evan Mobley to lead the future of this team. Depending on the playoff results, that picture may or may not include Donovan Mitchell. \n\nPlayoff Choker \nThe biggest one of them all in my opinion. How can a team, who's looking to get over the hump, who's known for choking in the post-season add one of the GREATEST playoff chokers in modern NBA history. I'm just going to go through the individual games and you let me know if this is consistent play from a hall-of-fame player? \n\n2015 vs GSW (G5)\nJames Harden: 14 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists, 13 turnovers.\n\n2016 vs SA (G6)\nJames Harden: 10 points, 7 assists, 6 turnovers, 3 rebounds \n\n2022 vs MIA (G5)\nJames Harden: 14 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists, 4 turnovers\n\n2022 vs MIA (G6)\nJames Harden: 11 points, 9 assists, 4 turnovers \n\n2023 vs PHI (G6)\nJames Harden: 13 points, 9 assists, 7 rebounds, 5 turnovers, 4 stocks \n\n2023 vs PHI (G7)\nJames Harden: 9 points, 7 assists, 5 turnovers, 6 rebounds, 3 stocks \n\n2024 vs DAL (G5)\nJames Harden: 7 points, 7 assists, 4 turnovers, 4 rebounds \n\n2025 vs DEN (G5)\nJames Harden: 11 points, 8 rebounds, 5 assists, 4 turnovers \n\n2025 vs DEN (G7)\nJames Harden: 7 points, 13 assists, 5 rebounds, 2 turnovers \n\nI could go on and on, he's a playoff choker. It's not just him having bad performances, its the multiple times we've caught him checked out of a game and not playing any sort of defense to help his team get back. At-least Darius Garland would put in 110% effort on a bad shooting night. Also, defensively, we're still about the same as Harden. Yes, he's a dealing with a much more defensive team in the Cavs, who rely on their front-court to be the motor, and he's a bigger defensive side, but he's not the same age as some of our players, nor do I think he's going to bring the same effort on the court because of what he could bring offensively to the table, which is my next segway... \n\nOffensive Pace \nA big reason why the Cavaliers are so good offensively is due to their pace, and ability to get looks off of the transition with ease. Let's compare the offensive paces from our 2024-25 season to now, including the offensive pace for the Clippers with Harden as the offensive leader:\n\nCavs\n2024-25 season: \nPace: 99.8 (10th in NBA).\nOffensive Rating: 121.7 (1st in NBA).\nPoints Per Game: 121.9 (1st in NBA).\n\nCavs\n2025-26 season: \nPace: 101.1 (7th in NBA)\nOffensive Rating: 117.6 (9th in NBA)\nPoints Per Game: 119.3 (5th in NBA)\n\n-----\nClippers\n2024-25 season:\nPace: 97.5 (22nd in the NBA)\nOffensive Rating: 115.1 (14th in NBA)\nPoints: 112.9 (20th in NBA) \n\nClippers \n2025-26 season: \nPace: 95.9 (25th in the NBA)\nOffensive Rating: 116.8 (12th in NBA)\nPoints: 112.7 (25th in NBA)\n\nThe Clippers are an older roster, and do rely more on shot-making from Kawhi and Harden, so this makes sense, but the stark difference in pace and offensive rating, coupled with a 36-year old who's not going to be able to give 200% on both sides of the ball, probably makes our offensive pace slower, especially when Harden's out there with the second unit and Mitchell is benched. If we increase the pace, there's more risk of injury for older players, like Harden, Merrill, Strus, etc. In today's NBA, your conditioning needs to be spot on, and Harden has done a great job at that so far, but he's in a much more youthful team with a high pace, a likeliness for transition breakaways, and high energy plays. \n\nThere's no doubt that James Harden's shot-making and ability to space the floor will make us more efficient, but at the same time we're losing pace, which 9/10's going to bring our points down with him on the floor along with our pace. We have seen the Cavaliers go on streaks of slow offensive pace, and this could be the trade to try and accommodate Harden into our offense, rather them him accommodating into ours. Which brings me to my next point. \n\nJames Harden Himself \nI think this trade is showing that the front-office is probably going to get LeBron James to rejoin the Cavaliers in his 3rd stint and have his farewell tour. I don't mind it. I think LeBron James deserves that from us, but the cost remains to be seen. We're hoping he takes a paycut and does it out of love. Right now, from what I'm hearing, we're willing to give him his coveted 2-year, $80M deal, and all this hinges on the fact that we're able to make it to a finals appearance or win the championship in June. Because if we can't, Mitchell's probably declining his player-option and we're probably going to start rebuilding sooner than later. \n\nJames Harden is a very up-front person, but he's not a player we should trust, AT all.\n\n[Via New York Times]\nJames Harden wanted to retire with 76ers, but 'front office didn't have that in their future plans. \n\n[Via JoeyLin - Twitter]\n“Once I leave and retire from being a Clipper, hopefully that culture can continue leading to something special.”\n\nJames Harden wants to leave a legacy with the Clippers. He also hopes people can begin understanding who he really is.\n\nSimply put, he's not trustworthy, and if we're going to give him a $40M extension, and he's declining in production and age, we're not helping ourselves in freeing money from the books, or having cap space to build for the future. We own three second round picks in the next six years, and two first round picks in the next four years, which have a bunch of stipulations. \n\n2026 FRP: Less favorable of (i) less favorable of (a) CLE and (b) more favorable of UTH 1-8 and MIN [or (i) CLE if UTH not conveyable] and (ii) less favorable of ATL and SAN then more favorable of (i) and (ii) to ATL;\nmost / more favorable of CLE, MIN and UTH 1-8 to UTH\n(via UTH swap for MIN; via UTH swap of UTH or MIN for CLE; via SAN swap for ATL; via ATL swap of ATL or SAN for CLE, UTH or MIN)\n\n2028 FRP: Least favorable of CLE, UTH and ATL;\nmore favorable of CLE and UTH to UTH;\nmore favorable of (i) ATL and (ii) less favorable of CLE and UTH to ATL\n(via UTH swap for CLE; via ATL swap for CLE or UTH)\n\nMostly all of the picks have a lot of stipulations, which is going to be revealed in all due time. James Harden is simply here for the money and for himself, which credit to him, it's worked for majority of his career, but we shouldn't trust him, and we shouldn't go ALL-IN because we won't have a back-up plan and there's not going to be anyone to save us. \n\nDoes anyone remember the mood after LeBron James left in 2018? The roster was destroyed, left with old veterans who clearly didn't fit the timeline of his team and G-League players. We drafted Collin Sexton, which I'm forever grateful that he panned out. Darius Garland even started his Cavalier' career rough, missing a bunch of games to a knee injury and simply not being able to shoot the basketball. The front-office was able to hit on 2 out of the 3 picks, which is a miracle for a franchise who's had some blunders over the past years, with Anthony Bennett being the most notable out of all of them. James Harden knows how to control the offensive game of the pace, but his play-style isn't pretty, and it's going to make the game slow for the rest of our players, unless he's willing to buy in and change that. \n\nObviously, with Strus returning and Merrill getting more games under his belt, I think we're still going to be one of the best offenses in the league, but with majority of the team not performing to their standard in multiple games in the playoffs, coupled with a player you can't trust, a known playoff dropper, and a shooting guard who struggles to get out of the second round (whether it's his fault or not), it's going to be a miracle for this to be fixed, and it feels like we're asking for another disappointing season at this point. \n\nI'm pretty sure we're not done trading, but if the roster looks like this come playoff time, a lot of it is going to hinge on Mitchell being able to play off-ball with James Harden. With two players who love having the ball in their hands, this creates problems from us, especially in the offense. This will most likely have Mitchell and Harden split minutes to have their own run at the offense while they're in the game. James Harden is a pass-first player, but he needs the ball to really execute on that. Also, this forces Evan Mobley to probably be another wing player, as two big men nearing the same vicinity on the court only clog things up. Luckily, Evan's been developing a three-point shot, which is much needed for a 5-out. The Cavs attempt around 41 threes a game, which is in the top five. We also like to neglect the paint sometimes and shoot-chuck threes every while, which doesn't make sense to me. James Harden doesn’t spring us to championship contenders in my opinion, so where’s this going…\n\nI could talk about the fit, our issues with rebounding in the post-season, and our tendency to resort to iso ball in the post-season after spending a whole regular season dictating the offensive pace of games and ball-movement. I hate this trade for the Cavaliers, and for someone who's been a fan of this team, I'm willing to eat my words (literally I'll print out this post and eat it), if we win a championship. But unless our bench (the likes of Tyson, Merrill, Ellis, Schroder, Strus and Tomlin) have massive improvements in the post-season and can deliver timely plays, I don't see how this is going to work out, and I truly do fear the worst for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the next two years. I understand Darius Garland wasn't able to play, and that severely hampered our ability to win a championship, but putting all your chips on a 36-year old to suddenly have a change of heart and identity is not the way to do it, and you certainly don't panic now, you let it unravel in the off-season, or in the season prior. For a franchise to do this, I'm assuming Darius Garland is going to be out for the next 1 1/2 years on the Clippers, because that toe might need two plates in it when he's playing basketball. \n\nToodles.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qw212u", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Southern_Tackle_6754", "score": 0, "comments": 17, "created_utc": 1770241517.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770480369, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "bbb0d348afdc22237a2152963f91e1f940afb7ed", "source": "reddit", "title": "A Pacers Package for Giannis", "body": "I'm a Pacers fan, and I'm not sure I'd want this... but couldn't the Pacers put together one of the best trade packages for Giannis?\n\nObi Toppin\n\nAndrew Nembhard\n\nBen Mathurin\n\nJarace Walker\n\nIsaiah Jackson\n\nTheir 2026 pick\n\na few more picks\n\nThat's 3 young players that will likely get better, and Toppin who is a quality role player.

Is Cleveland just another example of teams putting too much weight on the current season production and not taking into account the variance in player production. \n\nClearly Harden has had a much better season to this date, but both Harden and Garland are pretty high variance players. Harden has been on a high and Garland has been low, but it really won't be that surprising to me if both players put up very similar production the rest of the year or if Garland is better in the second half of the season than Harden. \n\nHarden is also clearly at his best when he gets to be the first option. He seems to be the type of player that basically puts up the same efficiency regardless of how many shots he's taking. Honestly he might even be a player, who's efficiency goes up the more shots they take. I expect him to look worse playing second fiddle in Cleveland then he did as a first option for LAC.\n\nOverall this just seems really short-sighted by Cleveland. Harden is at the age where his production is likely to fall off a cliff at some point in the near future. That could be the second half of this season, more likely next season, almost guaranteed that his production falls off a cliff two seasons from now. Garland is 26, is having a very rough year, but just put up solid numbers last year and is likely to bounce back to form. maybe there are some medical issues with Garland that teams know about that I don't, that make this trade make more sense.\n\nMaybe Cleveland is a little bit closer to competing this year, but the long-term future just got a lot more bleak in my opinion. \n\nEdit: \n\nA lot of people seem to doubt that Garland was ever really that valuable of a player.

I personally think this is just a down year, but maybe I'm not aware that his injuries make him unlikely to ever be good again. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1cufr6k/how_good_is_darius_garland_for_those_interested/?utm_source=chatgpt.com", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qvpm1f", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Advanced-Turn-6878", "score": 144, "comments": 136, "created_utc": 1770214371.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770480370, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "ddb63449d33ba8c633341967f4a22fc77441f935", "source": "reddit", "title": "What is the deal with Lebron?", "body": "As a player he seems incredible watched a video where he gers compared to MJ and he's almost as good as him and seems to be one of the best players in the league at his prime and one of the best players all around.

I don't watch much basketball, I'm starting to watch more and my brother seems to really not like him, my dad and my mom as well. It's not necessarily because he isn't good, he's good, my mom said he doesn't have a complete bag,  his cross is trash apparently. Lazy on defense, this one wasn't elaborated on that much I know he's older so he's defense may not be as good probably but it's like she meant it was always mediocre or something. \n\nThen there's his way of playing as well, he has like 20 min flopping montages, he hops teams(which isn't the best thing to do they say). Specifically when he moved over to the cavs and people didn't like that he overshadowed Wade and was basically like team leader. Me personally I don't think he's ass, I've heard most the stars and the way he plays was really dominant so like, what problems do people have with him fr. Or why does it seem like people either love him or really hate him lol?

Lakers get a lot of valuable pieces and all they are trading is an aging injury prone All-Nba player in AD, an up and coming 3&amp;D guard in Max Christie and a bunch of, to quote SAS, \"bonafide scrubs\" including a terrible D'Lo contract. All the while cashing in on a fever dream all time high valuation for DK. They do part with 2 unprotected firsts but its hard to believe that they will be in a good draft position with Luka having signed an extension.\n\nHell, all of the assets the lakers traded combined barely make a decent offer for just Luka, let alone a walking double double in Mark Williams and a valuable wing defender in DFS. All this while not gaining any cap space.\n\nRob Pelinka (rightfully) gets a lot of shit for his Lakers rosters but had the deadline trade gone through, maybe having a serviceable Center propels the lakers to deeper playoff run.\n\n**Do y'all agree? Or am I overrating the Lakers' return in these trades?**\n\nPS: I wanna add that by lopsided I mean in the short/medium term. Ofc big trades like Paul George to the Clippers or KG and Pierce to the nets ended up being very lopsided, but that wasn't apparent until years later.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1quur6y", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Mario_Viana", "score": 80, "comments": 21, "created_utc": 1770132122.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770480370, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "50aa20373a11b5abc6be25ee4cfe3b246295aea6", "source": "reddit", "title": "Chris Paul gets way too much flak for his supposed playoff underperformance.", "body": "Converting a comment into its own thread: I would contend that CP3, though he did underperform some, was beset by a unique combination of negative circumstances (that sometimes differed by the year) and didn’t really have a realistic window of contention in his time as a #1, from 2008 to 2017. His teams were consistently top-heavy and lacking depth, which is the easiest way to catch criticism as a great #2 (like Blake) makes it much harder to attribute a playoff loss to “lack of help” than a well-constructed team without one. They also got injured at inopportune times, and the eventual conference winner pretty much always much better/deeper.\n\nLet’s go year-by-year and look who he lost to/the general West playoff landscape, and see if he could’ve been reasonably expected to win:\n\n‘08 Spurs - core of Duncan/Parker/Ginobili/Bowen/Finley. Chose ‘08 to not be accused of cherry-picking as they’re actually somewhat comparable here — Fin and Bowen were old, Barry and Horry were beyond washed. Nonetheless, CP3 still faced a supporting cast deficit and appropriately lost narrowly.\n\n‘09 Nuggets - Melo/still-prime Billups/Nene/Smith/Martin/Birdman/Kleiza had them clearly out-gunned, especially with Chandler’s injury.\n\n‘11 Lakers - laughable disparity. A rotation of Paul/Ariza/Belinelli/Okafor/Landry/Jack wasn’t gonna beat even a creaky Lakers team consisting of Kobe/Odom/Gasol/MWP/Fisher.\n\n‘12 Spurs - again just a ridiculous first round match-up. Paul-Griffin-Butler-Foye-young DAJ-young Bledsoe against Duncan/Parker/Ginobili/Green/Neal/Zygote Kawhi/Diaw/Splitter. If they beat them they’d have to face a much better Thunder team.\n\n‘13 Grizzlies - Paul/injured Blake/Barnes/Crawford/Bledsoe/pre-prime DAJ against Randolph/Conley/Gasol/Allen/Bayless/Prince and co. Not a total mismatch but we’re talking about an injured Clippers facing a 56 win team in the first round.\n\n‘14 Thunder - not a mismatch, Durant had a slightly better supporting cast, but still a roster deficit. The Spurs, of course, had a much deeper team.\n\n‘15 Rockets - not a mismatch, but Paul was injured. They lose in 7. They are likely not beating the Warriors even at full strength, and they beat a 55 win, defending champ Spurs team in the first round.\n\n‘16 Blazers - not a mismatch, CP3 has some culpability here, though again he was injured. Nonetheless, even if they won, they had the 73 win Warriors team awaiting them.\n\n‘17 Jazz - here Griffin was injured. Paul played very well but again drew a 50+ win team in the first round and again would’ve had to beat one of the best teams ever to even make the final.\n\nIn sum: even in early-round settings he usually faced a supporting cast deficit, with the team they lost to not even necessarily being the strongest team on offer, while having extremely poor injury luck in a historically stacked/lopsided conference.\n\nThere was never a year where they, even at full health, would’ve had a better supporting cast than the eventual conference winner. There was one when they were somewhat close (‘14), but still no cigar.\n\nNote: I am not a Paul fan, find him insufferable, and don’t regard him as a playoff riser by any means. But it sure does seem that, once you examine things year-by-year, it becomes difficult to pin their lack of playoff success squarely on his limitations as a #1 option. You put those same teams out East and it likely completely changes how the average fan sees him.

It had comments but they were mostly low-quality. Or your post asked a straightforward question that can be answered in one word or sentence, or by Googling it. Try posting in our weekly questions thread instead.\n* *“My post met the requirements and is high quality but was still removed.*”\n   * Use in-depth arguments to support your opinion. Our sub is looking for posts that dig deeper than the minimum, examining the full context of a player or coach or team, how they changed, grew, and adjusted throughout their career, including the quality of their opponents and cultural impact of their celebrity; how they affected and improved their teammates, responded to coaches, what strategies they employed for different situations and challenges. Etc.\n* *“Why do posts/comments have a minimum character requirement? Why do you remove short posts and comments? Why don’t you let upvotes and downvotes decide?”*\n   * Our goal in this sub is to have a space for high-quality discussion. High-quality requires extra effort. Low-effort posts and comments are not only easier to write but to read, so even in a community where all the users are seeking high-quality, low-effort posts and comments will still garner more upvotes and more attention. If we allow low-effort posts and comments to remain, the community will gravitate towards them, pushing high-effort and high-quality posts and comments to the bottom. This encourages people to put in less effort. Removing them allows high-quality posts and comments to have space at the top, encouraging people to put in more effort in their own comments and posts.\n\nThere are still plenty of active NBA subs where users can enjoy making jokes or memes, or that welcome hot takes, and hyperbole (such as r/NBATalk, r/nbacirclejerk, or r/nba).

That's pretty much how it goes for us. We play to get more possessions with a shot off than other teams - be it through gambling for steals, getting blocks, or getting offensive rebounds all while getting out on the break. That is why we lead the league in fouls per game and why we are finding success despite being 20th in three point percentage. Turns out that more scoring opportunities mean something and I think we are trying to shift the meta. Will this style that finds success in the playoffs? I'm not sure. However Trajan Langdon is going to let it ride and use the playoffs to evaluate our long term needs after electing to hold off on making any big splashes at the trade deadline. Our fanbase is hopeful that Jalen Duren's right knee injury is just a minor setback for him, but it did knock him out of the dunk contest at All-Star weekend already. In other news, we converted the best two-way player of all time, Danis Jenkins, to a 2 year team option standard contract. \t|\n2\t|\t[](/OKC) Thunder\t|\t-1\t|\t40-13\t|\tAfter finally getting a couple solid wins off, our final bastion of success has fallen. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has strained his abdomen, and as a result the Thunder offense has and will plummet off a cliff. The only silver lining is that despite a skeleton crew of players being available, we played the Spurs and Rockets in two very close and surprisingly competitive games - almost such that it felt like wins? Looking forward, it seems JDub might be back today, and the all star break is the following week. And in a very bright and unexpected turn - it seems Topic is gonna start getting minutes in the G-League which would be part of his ramp up to finally play in the NBA after his battle with cancer. All to say: the Thunder _should_ be healthy after the ASB with guys like SGA, Jdub, and Mitchell all returning after extended breaks and with the potential addition of Topic - should improve OKC's ball handling a million times. ALSO WE GOT JARED MCCAIN LOL\t|\n3\t|\t[](/SAS) Spurs\t|\t--\t|\t36-16\t|\tStephon mf Castle, ladies and gentlemen. After nursing some injuries and even coming off the bench on a minutes restriction, Castle made history last Saturday night as the third-youngest player with a 40 point triple double behind LeBron and Luka, and the only other player in *NBA history* other than *Wilt Chamberlain* to record a 40 point triple double with &gt;75% shooting from the field. Debatably cherry picked, but when you're on a list by yourself with Wilt (or on another list with LeBron and Luka), you've done something damn impressive. Overall, while the Spurs still have the occasionally frustrating game, the team is handling the doldrums of the pre-ASB season pretty well--they're building a solid, if not necessarily safe, gap between themselves and the rest of the West for the 2 seed, the Spurs will be represented in every event at All Star weekend except for the 3 Point Contest (including by Mitch and our coaching staff!), and Wemby's been healthy and seems to have his minutes restriction fully removed at this point. The Rodeo Road Trip officially starts this week, but the ASB and Austin games will help break it up to more manageable levels than it's been in previous years (fingers crossed to the new stadium permanently ending the arrangement). The Spurs have @LAL, @GSW, ASB, PHO (Austin), SAC (Austin), @DET over the next two weeks.\t|\n4\t|\t[](/NYK) Knicks\t|\t+4\t|\t34-19\t|\tEl Bembé has arrived, and not a moment too soon as McBride gets put on ice until spring. Knicks have recovered strongly from prior losing, dropping only one shorthanded clunker to Detroit in the past ten. We're a top 2 team in net rating over the past couple weeks, and wins against Denver and Boston have helped the vibes tremendously. \t|\n5\t|\t[](/BOS) Celtics\t|\t+1\t|\t34-19\t|\tWhat a trade deadline. Not only did the Celtics swap Aferno Simons for Vucci Mane, but they managed to trade away Chris Boucher, Xavier Tillman Sr, and Josh Minott which got them under the apron *and* reset the timer on their massive TPE which is now at 27.68 million. While it seemed like many fans were hesitant to celebrate bringing in Vucevic due to his age and lack of any semblance of defense, his two games so far have been pretty great. Since the last rankings the Celtics have gone 6-2, with victories over the Trailblazers, Kings, Bucks, Mavericks, Rockets, and Heat, as well as losses to the Knicks and Hawks. Between now and the next rankings the Celtics will play only three times, but good lord what a three game stretch. They face the Bulls in what will be Simons return game immediately after getting traded. Then they'll face the Warriors in a game where Porzingis is expected to make his return, meaning the Celtics could face a frontcourt with Horford and Porzingis. Then they'll go play the Lakers and LeBron where if he were to retire this offseason, would be his last game against the Celtics. Completely unrelated, but I discovered my 10 year old nephew has been playing Strat-O-Matic baseball and it sent me down a rabbit hole into finding out they also have Strat-O-Matic football, hockey, and basketball. Sadly they don't currently sell practically any season pre-2017 for the NBA and the resell market has people asking for $500+ for old seasons, but they randomly have the 1998-99 season available and I'm hella tempted to buy it. \t|\n6\t|\t[](/DEN) Nuggets\t|\t-2\t|\t34-19\t|\tAnother week, another 4-6 week injury to add to the Hospital Nugs lineup, this time taking up and comer Peyton Watson out of commission. The Nuggets were able to break their 3-game skid with a comfortable win in Chicago, with a much needed break just around the corner. Oh, and Big Honey just passed the Big O in career triple doubles in his age 30 season, no big deal.\t|\n7\t|\t[](/HOU) Rockets\t|\t-2\t|\t32-19\t|\t\t|\n8\t|\t[](/CLE) Cavaliers\t|\t+2\t|\t32-21\t|\tThe Cavs went 5-1 in this stretch and now have the best record in the NBA since the start of 2026, with Jarrett Allen playing at an all star level in this stretch, putting up 22/11/3 over the last 5 games. When Jarrett Allen gets involved offensively, this team looks like it’s on another level: he’s got incredible footwork and a soft touch around the rim, along with sticky hands that reel in passes on the pick and roll as well as anyone I’ve ever seen. It’s easy to forgot how good Jarrett Allen is offensively when hardly gets double digit FGA in a game. The deadline saw us move our longest tenured player in Darius Garland for what is hopefully more than a rental in James Harden, while sending off Lonzo Ball for cap space, and De’Andre Hunter and Lonzo Ball for Keon Ellis and Dennis Schroder. We’ve lacked point of attack defense after trading Okoro for Ball, and we’ve lacked bench scoring from the guard position after not re-signing Ty Jerome, which Hunter for Ellis/Schroder directly addresses. The trades saved ~$100m in luxury tax payments, but the Cavs failed to get out of the second apron. Altman will be sitting in the hot seat if these trades don't lead to better results than we've gotten.\t|\n9\t|\t[](/MIN) TWolves\t|\t+2\t|\t32-22\t|\tThere is not a team in the nba that needs the all star break more than the Wolves. Not for the normal injury reasons but just to get away and refocus on the goals set before the season. Despite making some needed moves to the roster the team is just lifeless and lazy. \t|\n10\t|\t[](/LAL) Lakers\t|\t+2\t|\t32-19\t|\t\t|\n11\t|\t[](/TOR) Raptors\t|\t-4\t|\t32-22\t|\tThey keep blowing games man. Darko my guy some of this is on you. I hope they can get over the hump because the Raptor's play brililantly for 3 quarters at times just to blow it. Off of the top of my head, blown leads to Charlotte, La Clippers, New York, Orlando, and Minnessota. I know every team blows leads now and then, but damn a few wins out of those games would have had us 2nd in the East. \t|\n12\t|\t[](/PHX) Suns\t|\t-3\t|\t31-22\t|\tISHBIA HAS DONE IT! THE IMPOSSIBLE HAS HAPPENED! AT AGE 42... I mean, WE DIDN'T GO ALL IN AT THE DEADLINE! Not that I expected we would, but it's nice after years of big moves to have an established and *⋆｡°✩aligned✩°｡⋆* team that is a joy to watch instead of betting everything on some big name journeyman to fix everything. Speaking of that team, they've hit their projected win total of 30.5 before the trade deadline. We also have a better record that the 2023, 2024, and 2025 Suns at this point in the season. Three \"championship\" contenders. Now if we can actually get healthy for more than 2 games in a row, that would be nice...\t|\n13\t|\t[](/PHI) 76ers\t|\t--\t|\t30-22\t|\t\t|\n14\t|\t[](/CHA) Hornets\t|\t+8\t|\t25-28\t|\tFuck every single one of you who doubted LaMelo Ball and said he was a losing player. 14-1 with this starting lineup. Top 3 net rating over 25 games which is over HALF the season. 9 game winning streak. Apologize and admit you were wrong about him and the Hornets. We're coming for the playoffs and I think we can make some noise\t|\n15\t|\t[](/GSW) Warriors\t|\t-1\t|\t28-25\t|\tThe Tingus Pingus trade at deadline set Kuminga free. An abrupt end to the Giannis pursuit with minimal satisfaction. On paper this team has potential for *this* year IF all healthy but Jimmy is out for at least this year and most of next and this team is OLD. The Warriors future success as a contender with Steph is dim and the reality of a post-Steph Warriors is sinking in.\t|\n16\t|\t[](/MIA) Heat\t|\t--\t|\t28-26\t|\tI don't have much to say this week. The trade deadline broke me and many other Heat fans. Just pure confusion. Years in a row stuck in the play-in with zero roster moves whatsoever. We haven't even cut Rozier yet, despite the fact that he's an expiring... we literally could sign somebody right now if we just cut him. I'm not sure what the front office is up to and it's hard to keep faith right now. Good news is that Jakucionas and Ware both had huge games last night. The young guns look bright, it would be great if Spo would just force-feed them minutes, but we know that's not how he works. As for the team, we just look mid right now, and I don't see much changing post-All-Star. The only thing I'm looking forward to is seeing how much better Jakucionas and Ware will get as the season goes on. \t|\n17\t|\t[](/ORL) Magic\t|\t--\t|\t27-24\t|\tHot damn do we look inconsistent as hell night after night. Strong showings against the Heat and Nets, comeback wins against the Raptors and the tanking Jazz but then absolute shitshows against the Cavs twice, Thunder and Spurs. Only Franz is still out so you can't even really blame injuries all that much anymore, unless you believe Franz to be the second coming. Roughly 30 games left, no first round pick this year and solidly in a play-in spot with a chance to jump a few spots really gives the Magic just one option the rest of the season: deep playoff run or bust. In either case, most likely Mose is out as head coach. The roster seem to have started to tune him out, giving inconsistent effort on defense and just continuing to be overall inept on offense. Trade deadline was par the course in the Weltman era, trading Tyus Jones to shed salary and get under the luxury tax, and signing Jevon Carter to be a depth guard the rest of the season. Oh and Jase Richardson is following in his father's footsteps, participating in the Slam Dunk contest as a rookie. The only representation at All-Star Weekend so hopefully the rest of the guys can get some rest, mentally reset and get ready for the second half of the season.\t|\n18\t|\t[](/LAC) Clippers\t|\t-3\t|\t25-27\t|\tFirst and foremost, nothing but the best of luck to both James Harden and Ivica Zubac on their new teams. Thank you for being consistent positive presences on the Clippers, it is incredibly sad and startling to see all this happen so soon but most Clips fans agree that it was probably best to prepare for the next couple of seasons however we can. For this current season, however, we'll have to wait a couple of weeks to see it at full strength. Both Benny Math and Isaiah Jackson will probably get their debuts in the upcoming week, but Darius Garland probably won't be seen until after the ASB. All 3 will be welcome additions as the team hopes to stay competitive in the West. Kawhi, despite losing his starting guard and big man in the space of 48 hours, has continued to be an All-NBA level player, righting the ship of our offense singlehandedly until we get Garland in the mix. All us Clips fans can hope now is that we keep the fight out of the play-in spots going as we await the results of the draft lottery for the first time in a while.\t|\n19\t|\t[](/ATL) Hawks\t|\t+1\t|\t26-28\t|\tSo, the Hawks had a very busy deadline. The Hawks made 4 trades the week of the deadline, and all of them were rather interesting (for different reasons). The one thing that they all had in common was that they signaled that Onsi and the front office is focused on the future more so than the present. All in all, the Hawks have taken ~$34m off of their books for next season and gained 3 2RPs. I assume that the specifics of what the team ends up doing will heavily depend on where teh Pels/Bucks pick lands in the lottery, but no matter what Onsi is certainly maintaining optionality. ...I feel like there's something else to talk about... Oh yeah! The actual players we got! Jock Landale gives us another serviceable big man in the rotation, and Kuminga gives us a second player that can be physical and drive to the rim behind Jalen. Hield can provide some shooting, and I guess Vincent can give us vibes? Yeah, those last two aren't likely going to get many minutes, but at least they can provide some depth in case of injury. Atlanta now has 13 players that I'm comfortable getting play time, a notable improvement from a few weeks ago when we only had 11 (and one of those was a continuously injured Kristaps).\t|\n20\t|\t[](/POR) Trail Blazers\t|\t-2\t|\t25-28\t|\tPortland has missed more player-games than any team in the league, the the burden of those injuries are starting to pile up. The loss of Deni Avdija, who was recently named as a first-time all-star, has been particularly difficult to recover from. On the bright side, recently addition Vit Krejci has added some much needed shooting. Scoot Henderson has also looked very good considering how much time he missed. \t|\n21\t|\t[](/MIL) Bucks\t|\t+3\t|\t21-29\t|\tTold ya Giannis wasn't going anywhere mid-season. Getting Osumene Dieng and Cam Thomas entirely for free is pretty cool -- maybe one of them can be something for us. But at this point, I'm at peace with either tanking or sneaking into the play-ins, both could help prepare us for a huge offseason in different ways. \t|\n22\t|\t[](/CHI) Bulls\t|\t-3\t|\t24-29\t|\tOops, All Guards! We have finally committed to the tank, but still fucked it up. No 1sts, all 2nds, and zero bigs. But at least this tank is gonna be a fun tank. It's awesome watching Simons, Ivey, and Yabusele ball out. I like that we're focusing on developing our young players, and really spreading out the minutes so everybody has a shot at playing. I'm very curious how Giddey is gonna fit into this offense once he's healthy. With the trades, We definitely could've gotten a better return for Coby. I was shocked we didn't get a single first-round pick. The Ayo trade had me falling to my knees in the Burger King restrooms. That shit hurt. I know we got Dillingham, but come on. Ayo IS Chicago. Vuc trade was alright, we fleeced the Knicks for Yabubu, and fleeced Detroit too. I still wish we got some 1sts, but I should expect the Bulls front office to make horrible choices at this point.\t|\n23\t|\t[](/DAL) Mavericks\t|\t-2\t|\t19-33\t|\tIt was a somewhat busy trade deadline for the Mavs, moving a lot of the toxic parts of what represented the Nico era: Anthony Davis, D'Angelo Russell, Dante Exum (he had playoff moments in 2024, but re-signing him instead of OMax doesn't look great in hindsight), and Jaden Hardy were sent to Washington in a near salary dump. The Mavs also got Tyus Jones from Charlotte, and he will help mend the PG hole as Ryan Nembhard gets closer and closer to getting his two-way converted. Bagley had an impressive 16-12 with 4 blocks off the bench in his first game as a Mav on Saturday, so he should get some good reps to showcase his game for his free agency this summer. Dallas kept Gafford, Klay, and Naji Marshall, which makes the summer's trade opportunities interesting for the Mavs as they should by then have a full-time GM.\t|\n24\t|\t[](/MEM) Grizzlies\t|\t-1\t|\t20-31\t|\tALLLLLLL ABOARD!! The team is 100% committed to tank, with 13 picks over the next 7 years, and full ownership of all their own picks, the team has rightfully decided to build around Zach Edey and Cedric Coward as their new foundation. It appears that the best case scenario is we end the season with the 5th worst record, giving us a 42% chance at a top 4 pick. In this draft, that's probably good enough to get an elite player and start the rebuilding process over. The GM Zack Kleiman seems to think this will be a short rebuild, so maybe he knows something the rest of us don't as the team really does need a true #1. Of course, we're assuming Ja Morant is gone this summer. \t|\n25\t|\t[](/UTA) Jazz\t|\t--\t|\t16-37\t|\t\t|\n26\t|\t[](/NOP) Pelicans\t|\t--\t|\t14-40\t|\tThe Pelicans are 4-6 in their last 10. That doesn't sound impressive. But they are also 6-8 in their last 14. Which means they have won almost half their games on the season in the last 30 days. The status is awful but the trend is improving.\t|\n27\t|\t[](/BKN) Nets\t|\t+2\t|\t14-37\t|\tThe rookies are looking good and the Nets ethical tank continues. Nolan Traore and Egor Demin has progressed along nicely as the season has gone one. While the other rooks in Drake Powell, Danny Wolf, and Bern Saraf have their moments, they all have been struggling againt good teams while feasting against the dregs of the league. Development is key though so they will continue to get burn and we saw our first 5 rookie lineup (it did pretty well too) \t|\n28\t|\t[](/IND) Pacers\t|\t-1\t|\t13-40\t|\tIndiana surprisingly made a decently-sized swing at the trade deadline, acquiring center Ivica Zubac from the Clippers. Zubac satisfies a need that has plagued the Pacers for the last several seasons: rebounding. Obviously, it remains to be seen how much of an impact this move will make since all hinges on Tyrese Haliburton's return next season, but Indiana's willingness to make a move at this point signals their faith in Zubac's potential.\t|\n29\t|\t[](/WAS) Wizards\t|\t+1\t|\t14-38\t|\tWashington is officially in there \"First nice apartment after you graduate college move,\" acquiring very nice, expensive furniture for cheap despite the fact the furniture might not fit the style or the room\" era. The goal is to highlight the pieces that you'll actually proud and like -- the awesome couch, the bookshelves you built yourself, a really nice rug. But now, you have an oversized coffee table who's height doesn't line-up with your couch height. You can't be too upset -- it is a vintage coffee table, decently maintained except it keeps getting injured for some reason. It is just going to take time to get the fit to work. Anthony Davis adds another level of credibility to an organization that is desperately searching for it. It now just becomes a question of, \"Oh, we now have to try and make this whole thing work with the logjam we have in the Forwards of Youth on the line-up.\" Anyway, we're tanking. None of this matters for now.\t|\n30\t|\t[](/SAC) Kings\t|\t-2\t|\t12-42\t|\t\t|", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0g7bb", "subreddit": "nba", "author": "powerrankingsnba", "score": 23, "comments": 68, "created_utc": 1770670357.0, "mode": "hot", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770696294, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "766cacfb629adc39727e178a79f0c5e10e0d1178", "source": "reddit", "title": "[Highlight] Hornets vs. Pistons turns into a brawl!", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0neic", "subreddit": "nba", "author": "YujiDomainExpansion", "score": 6255, "comments": 1735, "created_utc": 1770687659.0, "mode": "hot", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770696295, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "0dd79c4f4702d416d9a0c3bff15707134116f278", "source": "reddit", "title": "[Highlight] Chaos in Charlotte!

https://ericmintzer.substack.com/p/giannis-kalshi-and-the-death-of-trust\n\n\\&gt; In the week leading up to the NBA trade deadline, Shams reported Giannis Antetokounmpo wanted out of Milwaukee. ESPN promptly named the Miami Heat, New York Knicks, Minnesota Timberwolves, and Golden State Warriors as potential landing spots. Over the next several days, Giannis trade rumors took over the sports news cycle. Major outlets discussed it seriously, debated fits, and framed it as a real possibility. Yet, as the deadline passed, the two-time MVP remained with the Bucks.\n\n\\&gt; Soon after, Giannis announced that he had taken a partial ownership stake in Kalshi, a prediction-market platform that allows users to bet on real-world outcomes. Kalshi hosts prediction markets on sports, politics, and pretty much anything, even the weather. In the weeks leading up to the deadline, roughly $23 million had been placed on Kalshi markets tied to where Giannis would end up.\n\n\\&gt; The situation presents a clear conflict of interest. Giannis publicly allowed trade speculation to build, and millions of dollars flowed into markets, guessing where he might go. When the deadline passed, he stayed in Milwaukee and also held a partial ownership stake in the platform that hosted those bets. Even without proof of intent, the overlap is hard to ignore. Kalshi’s markets visibly shifted in response to news updates and reporting about Giannis throughout the process.\n\n\\&gt; This concern is not theoretical. Over the past year, gambling scandals have erupted across major sports. In the NBA, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups were arrested in an FBI investigation into illegal sports betting schemes involving organized crime. Yes, that Mafia. In college basketball, federal authorities have revealed widespread point-shaving and match-fixing investigations. The scandal involved 39 players and 17 teams. In Major League Baseball, Cleveland Guardians pitcher Emmanuel Clase was federally indicted on charges including wire fraud, bribery, and conspiracy for allegedly rigging pitches in as many as 48 games.\n\n\\&gt; If we can’t trust the news, the markets, or the motives behind the stories we follow, then what are we actually watching? Sports only work if we believe they are real. Giannis did more than test that belief. He broke it. By tying trade speculation to ownership in a prediction market, he crossed a line that sports have treated as a cardinal sin for generations. It dealt a direct blow to fan trust and to the league’s claim of integrity.\n\n\\&gt; Once fans start asking whether outcomes, stories, and speculation are part of the show, the illusion is already gone. Gambling did not blur the line between performance and reality by accident. It made the blur profitable. And once uncertainty itself becomes the product, trust is no longer the foundation of sports.

Alongside that, I’ve built and maintained a historical database of graded high-impact NBA player seasons that I use for cross-era evaluation.\n\nAt this point, I’ve graded roughly the top 10–15 players from each of the last \\~40 NBA seasons (≈600 player-seasons total). The goal wasn’t just to build ranking lists, but rather to build a stable impact magnitude scale across eras. I periodically revisit those seasons as my framework improves to keep the scale internally consistent. When I evaluate current players, I’m placing them relative to that historical anchor map rather than evaluating them in isolation.\n\nMethodologically, this sits somewhere between pure modeling and pure scouting. I’m not running a single formula and publishing whatever number comes out. Instead, I use a triangulation process across multiple evidence streams and then map that combined signal onto historically calibrated impact tiers.\n\n# The Core Question\n\nThe central question I’m trying to approximate is:\n\n**What is this player’s intrinsic basketball impact level?**\n\nMore concretely:\n\n**If you added this player to a random NBA team, how much would he increase that team’s probability of winning a championship?**\n\nThis matters because value measured strictly within one team context is heavily influenced by role, roster construction, redundancy, coaching scheme, usage environment, and numerous other factors independent of a player's true level. Two players can generate similar impact signals on one roster while having very different portability across the league as a whole. So, how a player retains his value on different types of teams, not just the one he happens to be on, is important. The goal is to approximate a player’s average impact across many plausible team environments, not just the one he currently happens to be in.\n\n# How I Approximate That\n\nThe evaluation is a synthesis of several signal layers:\n\n**Impact metrics**  \nRAPM-family signals, possession-value box models, lineup and on/off data. These provide directional and magnitude signal but are always interpreted in context.\n\n**Film and mechanism evaluation**  \nFilm helps determine how impact is being generated and how likely it is to translate across defensive schemes and playoff environments.\n\n**Multi-year signal stabilization**  \nSingle-season spikes are treated cautiously unless supported by mechanism and historical precedent. To avoid drowning in statistical noise, it's important to use evidence from surrounding seasons to inform this season's valuation.\n\n**Contextual Factors**  \nSome skill packages historically maintain impact more consistently across team constructions, matchups, and playoff environments. Three big questions here: (1) how well does a player retain his value when paired with other high level teammates, and how well does he allow them to retain their value? (2) how well does a player's portfolio of skills translate to the style of play we see in playoff environments? (3) what other contextual factors (role, team construction, coaching, redundancies or lack thereof) might be inflating or suppressing the metrics beyond what we'd see from the player on a random team?\n\n**Historical calibration**  \nMy 600-season database is used to anchor magnitude. New seasons are placed relative to known historical impact clusters.\n\n# Midseason Context\n\nThese are midseason point estimates. I will calculate the final season version after the playoffs wrap up, and this will include explicit uncertainty ranges.\n\nAt this point in the season, tier placement and broad ordering tend to stabilize earlier than exact magnitude. Midseason estimates are anchored to prior full-season calibrated levels and adjusted based on current-season evidence so far.\n\n# Interpretive Scale for Net Valuations\n\n7.0+ → GOAT-level peak (≈ top 2–3 peaks ever)  \n6.0+ → All-time great peak (≈ top \\~10 peaks ever)  \n5.4–6.0 → Strong MVP level  \n4.6–5.4 → Solid MVP level  \n4.0–4.6 → Weak MVP level  \n3.0+ → Solid All-NBA level  \n1.5+ → All-Star level\n\nImpact estimates are (roughly) measured in points per game of impact contribution to a random team, adjusted to calibrate the proxy to added championship probability.\n\n# 2025–26 Midseason Snapshot\n\n\\~14 players considered for this exercise as candidates for the top 10 spots; assumes full health\n\n* format: Player X (point estimates for impact: OFF, DEF, NET)\n\n# Locks\n\nNikola Jokic — (6.2, 0.2, 6.4)  \nShai Gilgeous-Alexander — (5.0, 0.6, 5.6)  \nGiannis Antetokounmpo — (3.5, 1.4, 4.9)  \nVictor Wembanyama — (1.7, 3.0, 4.7)  \nStephen Curry — (4.4, -0.2, 4.2)\n\n# Near Locks / Very Strong Candidates\n\nLuka Doncic — (4.0, -0.3, 3.7)  \nKawhi Leonard — (3.1, 0.5, 3.6)  \nCade Cunningham — (2.9, 0.7, 3.6)\n\n# Remaining Candidates\n\n(Heavy confidence interval overlap, difficult to cleanly rank)\n\nTyrese Maxey — (3.3, 0.0, 3.3)  \nJalen Brunson — (3.6, -0.4, 3.2)  \nJamal Murray — (3.4, -0.3, 3.1)  \nAnthony Edwards — (2.7, 0.4, 3.1)  \nJaylen Brown — (2.8, 0.3, 3.1)  \nDonovan Mitchell — (3.3, -0.3, 3.0)\n\n— Top-10 candidate line —\n\nIf forced to add one more today:  \nChet Holmgren — (0.5, 2.3, 2.8)\n\nHappy to answer questions about methodology or discuss specific players.

It devalues your draft picks and risks injury of your stars. Isolating a single game, it is pretty significantly a bad value proposition to try to win. That is, unless you go deep in the playoffs or even win a championship. This is the thesis statement for tanking. And honestly, no clever trick or interesting rule has changed or will change that. If winning becomes a positive value, then you obviously have a positive feedback loop where good teams get value and losing teams lose value. As a result, any plan to fix tanking by making tanking less favorable will automatically make the balancing function between good and bad teams weaker, which is an essential aspect of the parity in the sport.\n\nSo for any solution, it seems like there are two major ways to truly end tanking: take wins and losses out of the equation or give the worst teams some assets that are more valuable on truly bad teams than they are on teams that are pretending to be bad. An extreme example of the former is literally why having a committee that decides who are truly the worst teams, factoring in sketchy tactics, strength of schedule, basically the reverse college sports ranking system and have that decide the lottery. The latter is a bit difficult to pin down. Ultimately, everybody needs talent. Good teams need talent. Bad teams need talent. Trade or salary exemptions are pretty important for everybody. Maybe something that can give teams more dart throws of talent? Like some eased restrictions or exceptions on trades that return more players than it sends for the teams at the bottom of the standings? This is definitely something that would need more thoughts.\n\nI'm not really positing a specific rule change to eliminate tanking, but I feel like I see a lot of threads that fall into the two obvious traps of neither actually flipping the script on wins having a significant negative value to non-contenders nor avoiding a situation where the worst teams stay losing.\n\nLet me know what you all think!", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qzujwb", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Round-Walrus3175", "score": 68, "comments": 45, "created_utc": 1770611234.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770696297, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "cda5d77f054bd8fb762190ed7dfa05667481185e", "source": "reddit", "title": "I don’t get the hate for “tanking” and ultimately it gives the NBA more parity than any other sports league (of the big 4 in America.)", "body": "I see a lot of people trying to come up with solutions to prevent tanking (purposely throwing games to get a higher overall pick.) \n\nIn the moment it sort of sucks if you follow a team day in and day out knowing they’re going to lose. But it’s the same thing if they genuinely suck. But it’s better for the NBA to have a team that’s mediocre tank to become competitive than a team that’s outright terrible year after year. \n\nCompare it to other sports. In the NFL there’s no lottery. The worst team gets the first pick. Yet, the same few teams dominate every year. Since 2011 every AFC championship game has had either the Patriots or Chiefs in it. I think coaching and general management/ownership impacts winning more than talent in the NFL. The best player in NFL history was a 6th overall pick. \n\nMatthew Stafford was a first overall pick and didn’t win squat with the Lions. Traded to the Rams and within a few seasons has a Super Bowl ring and MVP. All because he’s coached by an elite offensive coach. If you have bad ownership and bad coaching  you can have all the talent imaginable and you won’t win anything. The Jets, Browns, Raiders, etc.  \n\nNow look at the MLB. The Dodgers are well on their way to winning a third consecutive championship. And they’d have even more if they didn’t get screwed by cheaters in the WS back to back years in 2017 and 2018. Basically the rest of the teams are competing to be either the 2nd best NL team or for an American League pennant. The only team in recent memory that succeeded in tanking is the Astros and they cheated for one of their two championships. Teams that suck in baseball suck because their owners are penny pinchers. Even if they get elite draft picks they’ll just be traded or signed to a mega deal by a World Series contender once their contract is over. Paul Skenes is a good example. \n\nSure there’s “dynasties” in the NBA but nothing compared to the NFL, for example. The Warriors are the latest example. But Steph Curry only has 4 rings and has been playing since 2009. Mahomes already has 3 super bowls and started playing in 2018. \n\nPeople complain about tanking but will wear the jersey of the super star they wound up getting in the draft and when they win the championship they’ll forget their team even did it. People were up in arms over the Luka trade last year and the Mavs wound up getting Cooper Flagg because of it. And Luka hasn’t done anything with the Lakers. \n\n“It’s not fair to the fans that pay for tickets to see stars get pulled.”\n\nNot a real argument in a league that has random rest days and load management even for the elite teams. And if the team they paid to see sucks they only spent less than $50 for good seats on a ticket anyways. Total crapshoot on who you’re going to see play on any given day. \n\nWhy would owners risk whatever star players they have getting injured in ultimately meaningless games? Even if they don’t win because of the top overall pick, the revenue and ticket sales they get the following season are well worth it.\n\nAnd if you genuinely think tanking sucks, what’s the fix? You already have a lottery system. You want a play in tournament for the first few picks? Good luck getting owners and players to agree to play in even more games when they had to make rules to give the MVP to a player that plays most of the season. \n\nEvery suggestion I’ve seen has been terrible. A bunch of them are asinine like why don’t we take all the eligible players in the draft and put their names in a hat and have a team representative pick blindfolded and that’s the player they get.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qz8tjr", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "wetcornbread", "score": 0, "comments": 47, "created_utc": 1770557052.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770696297, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "26ba5483e44a18744b169a3a32b5bfc8da3a47fd", "source": "reddit", "title": "Why has NBA fandom become more about rings than enjoying regular-season basketball?", "body": "I’ve been thinking about this for a while, and I’m genuinely confused about why NBA fandom has become so ring-obsessed that it almost ignores the product most fans actually consume.\n\nMost fans are not front-office analysts. We’re not running championship probability models or thinking in terms of “windows.” We’re people who live in a city, buy tickets, and plan weekends around games. For us, the regular season isn’t filler, it is the product.\n\nTake the recent Cleveland Cavaliers teams. They’ve had strong regular-season records, a clear identity, young talent, and they play competitive basketball most nights. The arena is engaged, the team feels alive, and fans have something to look forward to week after week. From a fan-experience standpoint, that feels like success.\n\nOr take the Giannis-led Milwaukee Bucks over multiple seasons. Even outside the championship year, those teams consistently won a lot of regular-season games, had stars playing most nights, and gave local fans a high-quality product across the year. Yet even with that, seasons that ended short of a deep playoff run were quickly reframed as disappointments or failures.\n\nThat disconnect is what bothers me.\n\nA 50-win team that plays hard, has continuity, and gives fans meaningful games for 6–7 months is now treated as “stuck” or “useless” if it doesn’t make a conference finals or Finals. Front offices respond by dismantling good, watchable teams in the name of chasing a title that only one team wins anyway.\n\nFrom a fan perspective, that logic feels broken.\n\nThe parade lasts one day.\n\nThe season lasts eight months.\n\nWhy should I, as someone who actually attends games and watches weekly, accept a worse regular-season product now for a hypothetical payoff later? Why should I be happy with stars sitting, effort being managed, or teams pivoting toward tanking, all so the franchise can say it “maximized its championship odds”?\n\nWhat makes this worse is how ring culture trains fans to think like executives instead of fans. We stop asking “Was that a good basketball game?” and start asking “Does this translate in the playoffs?” We start defending decisions that make the regular season less enjoyable because media narratives tell us anything short of a title is meaningless.\n\nBut that framing benefits front offices, media debates, and legacy arguments, not the people in the arena on a random Friday night.\n\nEven good teams aren’t allowed to just be good anymore. If you’re not a championship team, you’re expected to either blow it up or radically reshape, which leads to endless cycles of rebuilding, short contention windows, and little continuity. The result is a league where your favorite team is either all-in for a ring or bad at everything else, with very little space for sustained, enjoyable competitiveness.\n\nI’m not saying championships don’t matter. Of course they do. But when the pursuit of rings starts devaluing the majority of games fans actually watch, something feels off.\n\nWhy can’t the default goal be: play hard, be competitive, build continuity, and give fans something to enjoy every other week, and if a championship eventually comes, great? Why does everything have to be judged only at the very end?\n\nGenuinely curious: at what point did NBA fandom stop being about enjoying basketball and start being about auditing legacies?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qyhs5k", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Kitchen_Pomegranate7", "score": 257, "comments": 150, "created_utc": 1770480723.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770696297, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "ab7c5194238b7deed5c248970a75d3a3b22a6ae5", "source": "reddit", "title": "Did big men stop being skilled in the 2010s, or were they just as skilled in the previous eras, but made obsolete by stretch bigs", "body": "Many 90s fans call their era the golden age of big men.

Indiana: I don't think Indiana wants to tank and I don't think getting rid of the lottery would change anything.    \n\n4. Brooklyn: They would continue to tank in either system.    \n\n5-6: Was, Utah: Both teams need to keep their pick, so they would tank in either system. However, because the lottery potentially drops their ranking, it encourages them to be worse than just 8.    \n\n7-9: Dallas, Memphis, Milwaukee: I think without a lottery system, these teams would not have any chance to break into the top 4. I don't think tanking for positioning between picks 7-11 is worth it. I think they'd compete harder if there was no lottery.   \n\n12-13: Chicago, Charlotte: Being in the lottery gives these teams incentive to stay there. No lottery would limit tanking.     \n\n15. Miami: Again, depending on how things go, they might.  benefit from breaking into the lottery and getting a chance at a top 4 pick. No lottery discourages tanking.    \n\n\nAs you can see, a no lottery system doesn't really affect the most egregious tankers, but it does limit tanking for teams in the 5-15 range.

But I see people either say he is an elite scorer and rising, or others say he is an inneficent complete ball stopper. So I wanted to explore a bit of whether Cam Thomas is an elite scorer or not.\n\nDisclaimer: I am a casual NBA fan, and I only watched 7-9 games of Cam Thomas, so this evaluation is extremely surface level.\n\nTo me, Cam Thomas isn't an elite scorer, he's a great shot maker, meaning he can make almost any kind of shot out there and it has a chance of going in The reason why I don't believe he is an elite scorer is that, to me, elite scorers have many different counters and answers to different defensive looks and sort of have a conceptual flow chart when they have the ball in their hand and can use athletic or fundamental advantages to get easier shots. And as a result, they can force the defense to adjust to them. For example, people like Kobe or SGA have several different answers to a multitude of defensive situations and counters within counters for the defense, while keeping things simple and leaning into tougher shots later in the shot clock or in the game when their teams need it.\n\nWhen I look at Cam Thomas, he can hit tough shots and get hot instantly, but his scoring ability is more limited due to his physicals and his height. He can get to his spots like the elbow or the key, but he has to work hard in order to get there and expend more energy than other scorers. And he doesn't have effective counters to what the defense is doing. As a result of this, he isn't great at generating space, and he tries beat the defense with his shotmaking ability, which leads to more difficult shots and less efficiency.  [Example 1](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;GameID=0022500704&amp;PlayerID=1630560&amp;Season=2025-26&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=&amp;flag=3&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game), [Example 2](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;GameID=0022500694&amp;PlayerID=1630560&amp;Season=2025-26&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=&amp;flag=3&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game).\n\nFor example, outside of shooting or driving, when he is open, if he can't drive to the basket, he would either step back for a mid-range get to the key for a floater/pull-up shot, or go all the way to the basket for a layup. He has more options/ reads than im giving him credit for when it comes to scoring, but my point is that his options are either not available or not effective once the inital reads are taken away.\n\nHe also doesn't have great size, elite handles, great shooting, or rim gravity, so he has to work extra hard just to create shots himself. He isn't much of a threat to defenses and they can defend these options without worrying about effective counters so as a result he can get easy buckets vs bad defenders or small defenders and can score well early in a season but once teams scout him or get closer to the playoffs the difficulty of his shots go up exponentially where his shot difficulty can be a 5 or 6/10 to a 8 or 9/10 which he can hit but not at enough of a rate for the shot to be effiecent in the first place. \n\nWhere Cam Thomas is at his best, in my opinion, is in early offense or transition and off the ball. Where he can start off with an advantage, where he can simplify his game, get to his spots easier, and reduce the difficulty of his shots, although his ceiling on these looks is not high especially this season, the efficiency for these looks has been lower than in 2023-24 and 24-25 [Cam Thomas | Guard | Brooklyn Nets | NBA.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1630560/shots-dash). He can use these situations to build a better foundation for scoring and increase his efficiency.\n\nI don’t believe that Cam Thomas is a ball hog. In my opinion, he's a willing passer, but he isn't consistently good at more complex reads. For example, if he is in the pick and roll or getting doubled, he will have issues locating the open man. Also, since he's on a bad team, he needs to get something going for the offense, and that means his shot selection can be wild at times to generate offense to make up for the lack of creation Brooklyn already has.\n\nAs a result, I don't think he is an elite scorer, he just doesn't have the tools that guys like Kyrie, SGA, Kobe, or Allen Iverson have to keep the defense on its heels. To me hes a microwave scorer and an elite shotmaker. He is sort of like a quarterback who thrives off one read, but when that read is taken away or limited, his efficiency goes down.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qx2c0f", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Comer_Agua", "score": 69, "comments": 100, "created_utc": 1770336769.0, "mode": "hot", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770696299, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "4e7d5a38411c7885a489223be2de503f714bd6eb", "source": "reddit", "title": "Post Game Thread - NBA: The Nets defeat the Bulls on Feb 9, 2026, the final score is 123-115.", "body": "This post contains content not supported on old Reddit.

That's pretty much how it goes for us. We play to get more possessions with a shot off than other teams - be it through gambling for steals, getting blocks, or getting offensive rebounds all while getting out on the break. That is why we lead the league in fouls per game and why we are finding success despite being 20th in three point percentage. Turns out that more scoring opportunities mean something and I think we are trying to shift the meta. Will this style that finds success in the playoffs? I'm not sure. However Trajan Langdon is going to let it ride and use the playoffs to evaluate our long term needs after electing to hold off on making any big splashes at the trade deadline. Our fanbase is hopeful that Jalen Duren's right knee injury is just a minor setback for him, but it did knock him out of the dunk contest at All-Star weekend already. In other news, we converted the best two-way player of all time, Danis Jenkins, to a 2 year team option standard contract. \t|\n2\t|\t[](/OKC) Thunder\t|\t-1\t|\t40-13\t|\tAfter finally getting a couple solid wins off, our final bastion of success has fallen. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has strained his abdomen, and as a result the Thunder offense has and will plummet off a cliff. The only silver lining is that despite a skeleton crew of players being available, we played the Spurs and Rockets in two very close and surprisingly competitive games - almost such that it felt like wins? Looking forward, it seems JDub might be back today, and the all star break is the following week. And in a very bright and unexpected turn - it seems Topic is gonna start getting minutes in the G-League which would be part of his ramp up to finally play in the NBA after his battle with cancer. All to say: the Thunder _should_ be healthy after the ASB with guys like SGA, Jdub, and Mitchell all returning after extended breaks and with the potential addition of Topic - should improve OKC's ball handling a million times. ALSO WE GOT JARED MCCAIN LOL\t|\n3\t|\t[](/SAS) Spurs\t|\t--\t|\t36-16\t|\tStephon mf Castle, ladies and gentlemen. After nursing some injuries and even coming off the bench on a minutes restriction, Castle made history last Saturday night as the third-youngest player with a 40 point triple double behind LeBron and Luka, and the only other player in *NBA history* other than *Wilt Chamberlain* to record a 40 point triple double with &gt;75% shooting from the field. Debatably cherry picked, but when you're on a list by yourself with Wilt (or on another list with LeBron and Luka), you've done something damn impressive. Overall, while the Spurs still have the occasionally frustrating game, the team is handling the doldrums of the pre-ASB season pretty well--they're building a solid, if not necessarily safe, gap between themselves and the rest of the West for the 2 seed, the Spurs will be represented in every event at All Star weekend except for the 3 Point Contest (including by Mitch and our coaching staff!), and Wemby's been healthy and seems to have his minutes restriction fully removed at this point. The Rodeo Road Trip officially starts this week, but the ASB and Austin games will help break it up to more manageable levels than it's been in previous years (fingers crossed to the new stadium permanently ending the arrangement). The Spurs have @LAL, @GSW, ASB, PHO (Austin), SAC (Austin), @DET over the next two weeks.\t|\n4\t|\t[](/NYK) Knicks\t|\t+4\t|\t34-19\t|\tEl Bembé has arrived, and not a moment too soon as McBride gets put on ice until spring. Knicks have recovered strongly from prior losing, dropping only one shorthanded clunker to Detroit in the past ten. We're a top 2 team in net rating over the past couple weeks, and wins against Denver and Boston have helped the vibes tremendously. \t|\n5\t|\t[](/BOS) Celtics\t|\t+1\t|\t34-19\t|\tWhat a trade deadline. Not only did the Celtics swap Aferno Simons for Vucci Mane, but they managed to trade away Chris Boucher, Xavier Tillman Sr, and Josh Minott which got them under the apron *and* reset the timer on their massive TPE which is now at 27.68 million. While it seemed like many fans were hesitant to celebrate bringing in Vucevic due to his age and lack of any semblance of defense, his two games so far have been pretty great. Since the last rankings the Celtics have gone 6-2, with victories over the Trailblazers, Kings, Bucks, Mavericks, Rockets, and Heat, as well as losses to the Knicks and Hawks. Between now and the next rankings the Celtics will play only three times, but good lord what a three game stretch. They face the Bulls in what will be Simons return game immediately after getting traded. Then they'll face the Warriors in a game where Porzingis is expected to make his return, meaning the Celtics could face a frontcourt with Horford and Porzingis. Then they'll go play the Lakers and LeBron where if he were to retire this offseason, would be his last game against the Celtics. Completely unrelated, but I discovered my 10 year old nephew has been playing Strat-O-Matic baseball and it sent me down a rabbit hole into finding out they also have Strat-O-Matic football, hockey, and basketball. Sadly they don't currently sell practically any season pre-2017 for the NBA and the resell market has people asking for $500+ for old seasons, but they randomly have the 1998-99 season available and I'm hella tempted to buy it. \t|\n6\t|\t[](/DEN) Nuggets\t|\t-2\t|\t34-19\t|\tAnother week, another 4-6 week injury to add to the Hospital Nugs lineup, this time taking up and comer Peyton Watson out of commission. The Nuggets were able to break their 3-game skid with a comfortable win in Chicago, with a much needed break just around the corner. Oh, and Big Honey just passed the Big O in career triple doubles in his age 30 season, no big deal.\t|\n7\t|\t[](/HOU) Rockets\t|\t-2\t|\t32-19\t|\t\t|\n8\t|\t[](/CLE) Cavaliers\t|\t+2\t|\t32-21\t|\tThe Cavs went 5-1 in this stretch and now have the best record in the NBA since the start of 2026, with Jarrett Allen playing at an all star level in this stretch, putting up 22/11/3 over the last 5 games. When Jarrett Allen gets involved offensively, this team looks like it’s on another level: he’s got incredible footwork and a soft touch around the rim, along with sticky hands that reel in passes on the pick and roll as well as anyone I’ve ever seen. It’s easy to forgot how good Jarrett Allen is offensively when hardly gets double digit FGA in a game. The deadline saw us move our longest tenured player in Darius Garland for what is hopefully more than a rental in James Harden, while sending off Lonzo Ball for cap space, and De’Andre Hunter and Lonzo Ball for Keon Ellis and Dennis Schroder. We’ve lacked point of attack defense after trading Okoro for Ball, and we’ve lacked bench scoring from the guard position after not re-signing Ty Jerome, which Hunter for Ellis/Schroder directly addresses. The trades saved ~$100m in luxury tax payments, but the Cavs failed to get out of the second apron. Altman will be sitting in the hot seat if these trades don't lead to better results than we've gotten.\t|\n9\t|\t[](/MIN) TWolves\t|\t+2\t|\t32-22\t|\tThere is not a team in the nba that needs the all star break more than the Wolves. Not for the normal injury reasons but just to get away and refocus on the goals set before the season. Despite making some needed moves to the roster the team is just lifeless and lazy. \t|\n10\t|\t[](/LAL) Lakers\t|\t+2\t|\t32-19\t|\t\t|\n11\t|\t[](/TOR) Raptors\t|\t-4\t|\t32-22\t|\tThey keep blowing games man. Darko my guy some of this is on you. I hope they can get over the hump because the Raptor's play brililantly for 3 quarters at times just to blow it. Off of the top of my head, blown leads to Charlotte, La Clippers, New York, Orlando, and Minnessota. I know every team blows leads now and then, but damn a few wins out of those games would have had us 2nd in the East. \t|\n12\t|\t[](/PHX) Suns\t|\t-3\t|\t31-22\t|\tISHBIA HAS DONE IT! THE IMPOSSIBLE HAS HAPPENED! AT AGE 42... I mean, WE DIDN'T GO ALL IN AT THE DEADLINE! Not that I expected we would, but it's nice after years of big moves to have an established and *⋆｡°✩aligned✩°｡⋆* team that is a joy to watch instead of betting everything on some big name journeyman to fix everything. Speaking of that team, they've hit their projected win total of 30.5 before the trade deadline. We also have a better record that the 2023, 2024, and 2025 Suns at this point in the season. Three \"championship\" contenders. Now if we can actually get healthy for more than 2 games in a row, that would be nice...\t|\n13\t|\t[](/PHI) 76ers\t|\t--\t|\t30-22\t|\t\t|\n14\t|\t[](/CHA) Hornets\t|\t+8\t|\t25-28\t|\tFuck every single one of you who doubted LaMelo Ball and said he was a losing player. 14-1 with this starting lineup. Top 3 net rating over 25 games which is over HALF the season. 9 game winning streak. Apologize and admit you were wrong about him and the Hornets. We're coming for the playoffs and I think we can make some noise\t|\n15\t|\t[](/GSW) Warriors\t|\t-1\t|\t28-25\t|\tThe Tingus Pingus trade at deadline set Kuminga free. An abrupt end to the Giannis pursuit with minimal satisfaction. On paper this team has potential for *this* year IF all healthy but Jimmy is out for at least this year and most of next and this team is OLD. The Warriors future success as a contender with Steph is dim and the reality of a post-Steph Warriors is sinking in.\t|\n16\t|\t[](/MIA) Heat\t|\t--\t|\t28-26\t|\tI don't have much to say this week. The trade deadline broke me and many other Heat fans. Just pure confusion. Years in a row stuck in the play-in with zero roster moves whatsoever. We haven't even cut Rozier yet, despite the fact that he's an expiring... we literally could sign somebody right now if we just cut him. I'm not sure what the front office is up to and it's hard to keep faith right now. Good news is that Jakucionas and Ware both had huge games last night. The young guns look bright, it would be great if Spo would just force-feed them minutes, but we know that's not how he works. As for the team, we just look mid right now, and I don't see much changing post-All-Star. The only thing I'm looking forward to is seeing how much better Jakucionas and Ware will get as the season goes on. \t|\n17\t|\t[](/ORL) Magic\t|\t--\t|\t27-24\t|\tHot damn do we look inconsistent as hell night after night. Strong showings against the Heat and Nets, comeback wins against the Raptors and the tanking Jazz but then absolute shitshows against the Cavs twice, Thunder and Spurs. Only Franz is still out so you can't even really blame injuries all that much anymore, unless you believe Franz to be the second coming. Roughly 30 games left, no first round pick this year and solidly in a play-in spot with a chance to jump a few spots really gives the Magic just one option the rest of the season: deep playoff run or bust. In either case, most likely Mose is out as head coach. The roster seem to have started to tune him out, giving inconsistent effort on defense and just continuing to be overall inept on offense. Trade deadline was par the course in the Weltman era, trading Tyus Jones to shed salary and get under the luxury tax, and signing Jevon Carter to be a depth guard the rest of the season. Oh and Jase Richardson is following in his father's footsteps, participating in the Slam Dunk contest as a rookie. The only representation at All-Star Weekend so hopefully the rest of the guys can get some rest, mentally reset and get ready for the second half of the season.\t|\n18\t|\t[](/LAC) Clippers\t|\t-3\t|\t25-27\t|\tFirst and foremost, nothing but the best of luck to both James Harden and Ivica Zubac on their new teams. Thank you for being consistent positive presences on the Clippers, it is incredibly sad and startling to see all this happen so soon but most Clips fans agree that it was probably best to prepare for the next couple of seasons however we can. For this current season, however, we'll have to wait a couple of weeks to see it at full strength. Both Benny Math and Isaiah Jackson will probably get their debuts in the upcoming week, but Darius Garland probably won't be seen until after the ASB. All 3 will be welcome additions as the team hopes to stay competitive in the West. Kawhi, despite losing his starting guard and big man in the space of 48 hours, has continued to be an All-NBA level player, righting the ship of our offense singlehandedly until we get Garland in the mix. All us Clips fans can hope now is that we keep the fight out of the play-in spots going as we await the results of the draft lottery for the first time in a while.\t|\n19\t|\t[](/ATL) Hawks\t|\t+1\t|\t26-28\t|\tSo, the Hawks had a very busy deadline. The Hawks made 4 trades the week of the deadline, and all of them were rather interesting (for different reasons). The one thing that they all had in common was that they signaled that Onsi and the front office is focused on the future more so than the present. All in all, the Hawks have taken ~$34m off of their books for next season and gained 3 2RPs. I assume that the specifics of what the team ends up doing will heavily depend on where teh Pels/Bucks pick lands in the lottery, but no matter what Onsi is certainly maintaining optionality. ...I feel like there's something else to talk about... Oh yeah! The actual players we got! Jock Landale gives us another serviceable big man in the rotation, and Kuminga gives us a second player that can be physical and drive to the rim behind Jalen. Hield can provide some shooting, and I guess Vincent can give us vibes? Yeah, those last two aren't likely going to get many minutes, but at least they can provide some depth in case of injury. Atlanta now has 13 players that I'm comfortable getting play time, a notable improvement from a few weeks ago when we only had 11 (and one of those was a continuously injured Kristaps).\t|\n20\t|\t[](/POR) Trail Blazers\t|\t-2\t|\t25-28\t|\tPortland has missed more player-games than any team in the league, the the burden of those injuries are starting to pile up. The loss of Deni Avdija, who was recently named as a first-time all-star, has been particularly difficult to recover from. On the bright side, recently addition Vit Krejci has added some much needed shooting. Scoot Henderson has also looked very good considering how much time he missed. \t|\n21\t|\t[](/MIL) Bucks\t|\t+3\t|\t21-29\t|\tTold ya Giannis wasn't going anywhere mid-season. Getting Osumene Dieng and Cam Thomas entirely for free is pretty cool -- maybe one of them can be something for us. But at this point, I'm at peace with either tanking or sneaking into the play-ins, both could help prepare us for a huge offseason in different ways. \t|\n22\t|\t[](/CHI) Bulls\t|\t-3\t|\t24-29\t|\tOops, All Guards! We have finally committed to the tank, but still fucked it up. No 1sts, all 2nds, and zero bigs. But at least this tank is gonna be a fun tank. It's awesome watching Simons, Ivey, and Yabusele ball out. I like that we're focusing on developing our young players, and really spreading out the minutes so everybody has a shot at playing. I'm very curious how Giddey is gonna fit into this offense once he's healthy. With the trades, We definitely could've gotten a better return for Coby. I was shocked we didn't get a single first-round pick. The Ayo trade had me falling to my knees in the Burger King restrooms. That shit hurt. I know we got Dillingham, but come on. Ayo IS Chicago. Vuc trade was alright, we fleeced the Knicks for Yabubu, and fleeced Detroit too. I still wish we got some 1sts, but I should expect the Bulls front office to make horrible choices at this point.\t|\n23\t|\t[](/DAL) Mavericks\t|\t-2\t|\t19-33\t|\tIt was a somewhat busy trade deadline for the Mavs, moving a lot of the toxic parts of what represented the Nico era: Anthony Davis, D'Angelo Russell, Dante Exum (he had playoff moments in 2024, but re-signing him instead of OMax doesn't look great in hindsight), and Jaden Hardy were sent to Washington in a near salary dump. The Mavs also got Tyus Jones from Charlotte, and he will help mend the PG hole as Ryan Nembhard gets closer and closer to getting his two-way converted. Bagley had an impressive 16-12 with 4 blocks off the bench in his first game as a Mav on Saturday, so he should get some good reps to showcase his game for his free agency this summer. Dallas kept Gafford, Klay, and Naji Marshall, which makes the summer's trade opportunities interesting for the Mavs as they should by then have a full-time GM.\t|\n24\t|\t[](/MEM) Grizzlies\t|\t-1\t|\t20-31\t|\tALLLLLLL ABOARD!! The team is 100% committed to tank, with 13 picks over the next 7 years, and full ownership of all their own picks, the team has rightfully decided to build around Zach Edey and Cedric Coward as their new foundation. It appears that the best case scenario is we end the season with the 5th worst record, giving us a 42% chance at a top 4 pick. In this draft, that's probably good enough to get an elite player and start the rebuilding process over. The GM Zack Kleiman seems to think this will be a short rebuild, so maybe he knows something the rest of us don't as the team really does need a true #1. Of course, we're assuming Ja Morant is gone this summer. \t|\n25\t|\t[](/UTA) Jazz\t|\t--\t|\t16-37\t|\t\t|\n26\t|\t[](/NOP) Pelicans\t|\t--\t|\t14-40\t|\tThe Pelicans are 4-6 in their last 10. That doesn't sound impressive. But they are also 6-8 in their last 14. Which means they have won almost half their games on the season in the last 30 days. The status is awful but the trend is improving.\t|\n27\t|\t[](/BKN) Nets\t|\t+2\t|\t14-37\t|\tThe rookies are looking good and the Nets ethical tank continues. Nolan Traore and Egor Demin has progressed along nicely as the season has gone one. While the other rooks in Drake Powell, Danny Wolf, and Bern Saraf have their moments, they all have been struggling againt good teams while feasting against the dregs of the league. Development is key though so they will continue to get burn and we saw our first 5 rookie lineup (it did pretty well too) \t|\n28\t|\t[](/IND) Pacers\t|\t-1\t|\t13-40\t|\tIndiana surprisingly made a decently-sized swing at the trade deadline, acquiring center Ivica Zubac from the Clippers. Zubac satisfies a need that has plagued the Pacers for the last several seasons: rebounding. Obviously, it remains to be seen how much of an impact this move will make since all hinges on Tyrese Haliburton's return next season, but Indiana's willingness to make a move at this point signals their faith in Zubac's potential.\t|\n29\t|\t[](/WAS) Wizards\t|\t+1\t|\t14-38\t|\tWashington is officially in there \"First nice apartment after you graduate college move,\" acquiring very nice, expensive furniture for cheap despite the fact the furniture might not fit the style or the room\" era. The goal is to highlight the pieces that you'll actually proud and like -- the awesome couch, the bookshelves you built yourself, a really nice rug. But now, you have an oversized coffee table who's height doesn't line-up with your couch height. You can't be too upset -- it is a vintage coffee table, decently maintained except it keeps getting injured for some reason. It is just going to take time to get the fit to work. Anthony Davis adds another level of credibility to an organization that is desperately searching for it. It now just becomes a question of, \"Oh, we now have to try and make this whole thing work with the logjam we have in the Forwards of Youth on the line-up.\" Anyway, we're tanking. None of this matters for now.\t|\n30\t|\t[](/SAC) Kings\t|\t-2\t|\t12-42\t|\t\t|", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0g7bb", "subreddit": "nba", "author": "powerrankingsnba", "score": 25, "comments": 69, "created_utc": 1770670357.0, "mode": "hot", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770697119, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "ff0caa49c138a2d00c65b126a9d86a9ac3d04bb2", "source": "reddit", "title": "[Highlight] Hornets vs. Pistons turns into a brawl!", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0neic", "subreddit": "nba", "author": "YujiDomainExpansion", "score": 6508, "comments": 1774, "created_utc": 1770687659.0, "mode": "hot", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770697119, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "ba11bb2f2d48e8f825ea9b4a07456a40c796c0e1", "source": "reddit", "title": "[Highlight] Chaos in Charlotte!

ESPN promptly named the Miami Heat, New York Knicks, Minnesota Timberwolves, and Golden State Warriors as potential landing spots. Over the next several days, Giannis trade rumors took over the sports news cycle. Major outlets discussed it seriously, debated fits, and framed it as a real possibility. Yet, as the deadline passed, the two-time MVP remained with the Bucks.\n\n\\&gt; Soon after, Giannis announced that he had taken a partial ownership stake in Kalshi, a prediction-market platform that allows users to bet on real-world outcomes. Kalshi hosts prediction markets on sports, politics, and pretty much anything, even the weather. In the weeks leading up to the deadline, roughly $23 million had been placed on Kalshi markets tied to where Giannis would end up.\n\n\\&gt; The situation presents a clear conflict of interest. Giannis publicly allowed trade speculation to build, and millions of dollars flowed into markets, guessing where he might go. When the deadline passed, he stayed in Milwaukee and also held a partial ownership stake in the platform that hosted those bets. Even without proof of intent, the overlap is hard to ignore. Kalshi’s markets visibly shifted in response to news updates and reporting about Giannis throughout the process.\n\n\\&gt; This concern is not theoretical. Over the past year, gambling scandals have erupted across major sports. In the NBA, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups were arrested in an FBI investigation into illegal sports betting schemes involving organized crime. Yes, that Mafia. In college basketball, federal authorities have revealed widespread point-shaving and match-fixing investigations. The scandal involved 39 players and 17 teams. In Major League Baseball, Cleveland Guardians pitcher Emmanuel Clase was federally indicted on charges including wire fraud, bribery, and conspiracy for allegedly rigging pitches in as many as 48 games.\n\n\\&gt; If we can’t trust the news, the markets, or the motives behind the stories we follow, then what are we actually watching? Sports only work if we believe they are real. Giannis did more than test that belief. He broke it. By tying trade speculation to ownership in a prediction market, he crossed a line that sports have treated as a cardinal sin for generations. It dealt a direct blow to fan trust and to the league’s claim of integrity.\n\n\\&gt; Once fans start asking whether outcomes, stories, and speculation are part of the show, the illusion is already gone. Gambling did not blur the line between performance and reality by accident. It made the blur profitable. And once uncertainty itself becomes the product, trust is no longer the foundation of sports. It becomes the wager.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r08lua", "subreddit": "nba", "author": "mastermind208", "score": 8894, "comments": 844, "created_utc": 1770654120.0, "mode": "hot", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770697120, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "fc6f0ad855a6c5f25b16dc0470a68d872a6b1adf", "source": "reddit", "title": "[Highlight] Duncan Robinson’s reaction to his teammates getting into a serious altercation:", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0ns64", "subreddit": "nba", "author": "YujiDomainExpansion", "score": 1270, "comments": 164, "created_utc": 1770688671.0, "mode": "hot", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770697120, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "dad4638fff9038bbf0df6b5181c2768d86c7fc38", "source": "reddit", "title": "[Highlight] Pistons &amp; Hornets get into a brawl", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0nolc", "subreddit": "nba", "author": "LaDainianTomIinson", "score": 1267, "comments": 280, "created_utc": 1770688408.0, "mode": "hot", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770697121, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "1fb268054515bfff73b0d4cbdb7b10f08bd9c8bc", "source": "reddit", "title": "2025-26 Midseason Player Evaluations: Who are the best players in the NBA?", "body": "Over the last decade I’ve worked in data analytics environments and applied inferential statistical methods both inside and outside basketball contexts. Alongside that, I’ve built and maintained a historical database of graded high-impact NBA player seasons that I use for cross-era evaluation.\n\nAt this point, I’ve graded roughly the top 10–15 players from each of the last \\~40 NBA seasons (≈600 player-seasons total). The goal wasn’t just to build ranking lists, but rather to build a stable impact magnitude scale across eras. I periodically revisit those seasons as my framework improves to keep the scale internally consistent. When I evaluate current players, I’m placing them relative to that historical anchor map rather than evaluating them in isolation.\n\nMethodologically, this sits somewhere between pure modeling and pure scouting. I’m not running a single formula and publishing whatever number comes out. Instead, I use a triangulation process across multiple evidence streams and then map that combined signal onto historically calibrated impact tiers.\n\n# The Core Question\n\nThe central question I’m trying to approximate is:\n\n**What is this player’s intrinsic basketball impact level?**\n\nMore concretely:\n\n**If you added this player to a random NBA team, how much would he increase that team’s probability of winning a championship?**\n\nThis matters because value measured strictly within one team context is heavily influenced by role, roster construction, redundancy, coaching scheme, usage environment, and numerous other factors independent of a player's true level. Two players can generate similar impact signals on one roster while having very different portability across the league as a whole. So, how a player retains his value on different types of teams, not just the one he happens to be on, is important. The goal is to approximate a player’s average impact across many plausible team environments, not just the one he currently happens to be in.\n\n# How I Approximate That\n\nThe evaluation is a synthesis of several signal layers:\n\n**Impact metrics**  \nRAPM-family signals, possession-value box models, lineup and on/off data. These provide directional and magnitude signal but are always interpreted in context.\n\n**Film and mechanism evaluation**  \nFilm helps determine how impact is being generated and how likely it is to translate across defensive schemes and playoff environments.\n\n**Multi-year signal stabilization**  \nSingle-season spikes are treated cautiously unless supported by mechanism and historical precedent. To avoid drowning in statistical noise, it's important to use evidence from surrounding seasons to inform this season's valuation.\n\n**Contextual Factors**  \nSome skill packages historically maintain impact more consistently across team constructions, matchups, and playoff environments. Three big questions here: (1) how well does a player retain his value when paired with other high level teammates, and how well does he allow them to retain their value? (2) how well does a player's portfolio of skills translate to the style of play we see in playoff environments? (3) what other contextual factors (role, team construction, coaching, redundancies or lack thereof) might be inflating or suppressing the metrics beyond what we'd see from the player on a random team?\n\n**Historical calibration**  \nMy 600-season database is used to anchor magnitude. New seasons are placed relative to known historical impact clusters.\n\n# Midseason Context\n\nThese are midseason point estimates. I will calculate the final season version after the playoffs wrap up, and this will include explicit uncertainty ranges.\n\nAt this point in the season, tier placement and broad ordering tend to stabilize earlier than exact magnitude. Midseason estimates are anchored to prior full-season calibrated levels and adjusted based on current-season evidence so far.\n\n# Interpretive Scale for Net Valuations\n\n7.0+ → GOAT-level peak (≈ top 2–3 peaks ever)  \n6.0+ → All-time great peak (≈ top \\~10 peaks ever)  \n5.4–6.0 → Strong MVP level  \n4.6–5.4 → Solid MVP level  \n4.0–4.6 → Weak MVP level  \n3.0+ → Solid All-NBA level  \n1.5+ → All-Star level\n\nImpact estimates are (roughly) measured in points per game of impact contribution to a random team, adjusted to calibrate the proxy to added championship probability.\n\n# 2025–26 Midseason Snapshot\n\n\\~14 players considered for this exercise as candidates for the top 10 spots; assumes full health\n\n* format: Player X (point estimates for impact: OFF, DEF, NET)\n\n# Locks\n\nNikola Jokic — (6.2, 0.2, 6.4)  \nShai Gilgeous-Alexander — (5.0, 0.6, 5.6)  \nGiannis Antetokounmpo — (3.5, 1.4, 4.9)  \nVictor Wembanyama — (1.7, 3.0, 4.7)  \nStephen Curry — (4.4, -0.2, 4.2)\n\n# Near Locks / Very Strong Candidates\n\nLuka Doncic — (4.0, -0.3, 3.7)  \nKawhi Leonard — (3.1, 0.5, 3.6)  \nCade Cunningham — (2.9, 0.7, 3.6)\n\n# Remaining Candidates\n\n(Heavy confidence interval overlap, difficult to cleanly rank)\n\nTyrese Maxey — (3.3, 0.0, 3.3)  \nJalen Brunson — (3.6, -0.4, 3.2)  \nJamal Murray — (3.4, -0.3, 3.1)  \nAnthony Edwards — (2.7, 0.4, 3.1)  \nJaylen Brown — (2.8, 0.3, 3.1)  \nDonovan Mitchell — (3.3, -0.3, 3.0)\n\n— Top-10 candidate line —\n\nIf forced to add one more today:  \nChet Holmgren — (0.5, 2.3, 2.8)\n\nHappy to answer questions about methodology or discuss specific players.

It devalues your draft picks and risks injury of your stars. Isolating a single game, it is pretty significantly a bad value proposition to try to win. That is, unless you go deep in the playoffs or even win a championship. This is the thesis statement for tanking. And honestly, no clever trick or interesting rule has changed or will change that. If winning becomes a positive value, then you obviously have a positive feedback loop where good teams get value and losing teams lose value. As a result, any plan to fix tanking by making tanking less favorable will automatically make the balancing function between good and bad teams weaker, which is an essential aspect of the parity in the sport.\n\nSo for any solution, it seems like there are two major ways to truly end tanking: take wins and losses out of the equation or give the worst teams some assets that are more valuable on truly bad teams than they are on teams that are pretending to be bad. An extreme example of the former is literally why having a committee that decides who are truly the worst teams, factoring in sketchy tactics, strength of schedule, basically the reverse college sports ranking system and have that decide the lottery. The latter is a bit difficult to pin down. Ultimately, everybody needs talent. Good teams need talent. Bad teams need talent. Trade or salary exemptions are pretty important for everybody. Maybe something that can give teams more dart throws of talent? Like some eased restrictions or exceptions on trades that return more players than it sends for the teams at the bottom of the standings? This is definitely something that would need more thoughts.\n\nI'm not really positing a specific rule change to eliminate tanking, but I feel like I see a lot of threads that fall into the two obvious traps of neither actually flipping the script on wins having a significant negative value to non-contenders nor avoiding a situation where the worst teams stay losing.\n\nLet me know what you all think!", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qzujwb", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Round-Walrus3175", "score": 66, "comments": 45, "created_utc": 1770611234.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770697121, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "ef697b219aa5b09a5da9863b694bedc8ea25f485", "source": "reddit", "title": "I don’t get the hate for “tanking” and ultimately it gives the NBA more parity than any other sports league (of the big 4 in America.)", "body": "I see a lot of people trying to come up with solutions to prevent tanking (purposely throwing games to get a higher overall pick.) \n\nIn the moment it sort of sucks if you follow a team day in and day out knowing they’re going to lose. But it’s the same thing if they genuinely suck. But it’s better for the NBA to have a team that’s mediocre tank to become competitive than a team that’s outright terrible year after year. \n\nCompare it to other sports. In the NFL there’s no lottery. The worst team gets the first pick. Yet, the same few teams dominate every year. Since 2011 every AFC championship game has had either the Patriots or Chiefs in it. I think coaching and general management/ownership impacts winning more than talent in the NFL. The best player in NFL history was a 6th overall pick. \n\nMatthew Stafford was a first overall pick and didn’t win squat with the Lions. Traded to the Rams and within a few seasons has a Super Bowl ring and MVP. All because he’s coached by an elite offensive coach. If you have bad ownership and bad coaching  you can have all the talent imaginable and you won’t win anything. The Jets, Browns, Raiders, etc.  \n\nNow look at the MLB. The Dodgers are well on their way to winning a third consecutive championship. And they’d have even more if they didn’t get screwed by cheaters in the WS back to back years in 2017 and 2018. Basically the rest of the teams are competing to be either the 2nd best NL team or for an American League pennant. The only team in recent memory that succeeded in tanking is the Astros and they cheated for one of their two championships. Teams that suck in baseball suck because their owners are penny pinchers. Even if they get elite draft picks they’ll just be traded or signed to a mega deal by a World Series contender once their contract is over. Paul Skenes is a good example. \n\nSure there’s “dynasties” in the NBA but nothing compared to the NFL, for example. The Warriors are the latest example. But Steph Curry only has 4 rings and has been playing since 2009. Mahomes already has 3 super bowls and started playing in 2018. \n\nPeople complain about tanking but will wear the jersey of the super star they wound up getting in the draft and when they win the championship they’ll forget their team even did it. People were up in arms over the Luka trade last year and the Mavs wound up getting Cooper Flagg because of it. And Luka hasn’t done anything with the Lakers. \n\n“It’s not fair to the fans that pay for tickets to see stars get pulled.”\n\nNot a real argument in a league that has random rest days and load management even for the elite teams. And if the team they paid to see sucks they only spent less than $50 for good seats on a ticket anyways. Total crapshoot on who you’re going to see play on any given day. \n\nWhy would owners risk whatever star players they have getting injured in ultimately meaningless games? Even if they don’t win because of the top overall pick, the revenue and ticket sales they get the following season are well worth it.\n\nAnd if you genuinely think tanking sucks, what’s the fix? You already have a lottery system. You want a play in tournament for the first few picks? Good luck getting owners and players to agree to play in even more games when they had to make rules to give the MVP to a player that plays most of the season. \n\nEvery suggestion I’ve seen has been terrible. A bunch of them are asinine like why don’t we take all the eligible players in the draft and put their names in a hat and have a team representative pick blindfolded and that’s the player they get.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qz8tjr", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "wetcornbread", "score": 0, "comments": 47, "created_utc": 1770557052.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770697122, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "5420f1903d7720d98199b8e96c4ad91ba1684b40", "source": "reddit", "title": "Why has NBA fandom become more about rings than enjoying regular-season basketball?", "body": "I’ve been thinking about this for a while, and I’m genuinely confused about why NBA fandom has become so ring-obsessed that it almost ignores the product most fans actually consume.\n\nMost fans are not front-office analysts. We’re not running championship probability models or thinking in terms of “windows.” We’re people who live in a city, buy tickets, and plan weekends around games. For us, the regular season isn’t filler, it is the product.\n\nTake the recent Cleveland Cavaliers teams. They’ve had strong regular-season records, a clear identity, young talent, and they play competitive basketball most nights. The arena is engaged, the team feels alive, and fans have something to look forward to week after week. From a fan-experience standpoint, that feels like success.\n\nOr take the Giannis-led Milwaukee Bucks over multiple seasons. Even outside the championship year, those teams consistently won a lot of regular-season games, had stars playing most nights, and gave local fans a high-quality product across the year. Yet even with that, seasons that ended short of a deep playoff run were quickly reframed as disappointments or failures.\n\nThat disconnect is what bothers me.\n\nA 50-win team that plays hard, has continuity, and gives fans meaningful games for 6–7 months is now treated as “stuck” or “useless” if it doesn’t make a conference finals or Finals. Front offices respond by dismantling good, watchable teams in the name of chasing a title that only one team wins anyway.\n\nFrom a fan perspective, that logic feels broken.\n\nThe parade lasts one day.\n\nThe season lasts eight months.\n\nWhy should I, as someone who actually attends games and watches weekly, accept a worse regular-season product now for a hypothetical payoff later? Why should I be happy with stars sitting, effort being managed, or teams pivoting toward tanking, all so the franchise can say it “maximized its championship odds”?\n\nWhat makes this worse is how ring culture trains fans to think like executives instead of fans. We stop asking “Was that a good basketball game?” and start asking “Does this translate in the playoffs?” We start defending decisions that make the regular season less enjoyable because media narratives tell us anything short of a title is meaningless.\n\nBut that framing benefits front offices, media debates, and legacy arguments, not the people in the arena on a random Friday night.\n\nEven good teams aren’t allowed to just be good anymore. If you’re not a championship team, you’re expected to either blow it up or radically reshape, which leads to endless cycles of rebuilding, short contention windows, and little continuity. The result is a league where your favorite team is either all-in for a ring or bad at everything else, with very little space for sustained, enjoyable competitiveness.\n\nI’m not saying championships don’t matter. Of course they do. But when the pursuit of rings starts devaluing the majority of games fans actually watch, something feels off.\n\nWhy can’t the default goal be: play hard, be competitive, build continuity, and give fans something to enjoy every other week, and if a championship eventually comes, great? Why does everything have to be judged only at the very end?\n\nGenuinely curious: at what point did NBA fandom stop being about enjoying basketball and start being about auditing legacies?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qyhs5k", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Kitchen_Pomegranate7", "score": 253, "comments": 150, "created_utc": 1770480723.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770697122, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "52719b49a5671c363981b039f7afafbea086eb72", "source": "reddit", "title": "Did big men stop being skilled in the 2010s, or were they just as skilled in the previous eras, but made obsolete by stretch bigs", "body": "Many 90s fans call their era the golden age of big men.

The chance at a #1 pick basically incentivizes every team to be as worse as possible. Let's look at the current tankathon.com rankings and the teams that own their own picks and might tank:   \n\n\n1: Sacramento: Obviously they would still tank if there's no lottery.  \n\n3. Indiana: I don't think Indiana wants to tank and I don't think getting rid of the lottery would change anything.    \n\n4. Brooklyn: They would continue to tank in either system.    \n\n5-6: Was, Utah: Both teams need to keep their pick, so they would tank in either system. However, because the lottery potentially drops their ranking, it encourages them to be worse than just 8.    \n\n7-9: Dallas, Memphis, Milwaukee: I think without a lottery system, these teams would not have any chance to break into the top 4. I don't think tanking for positioning between picks 7-11 is worth it. I think they'd compete harder if there was no lottery.   \n\n12-13: Chicago, Charlotte: Being in the lottery gives these teams incentive to stay there. No lottery would limit tanking.     \n\n15. Miami: Again, depending on how things go, they might.  benefit from breaking into the lottery and getting a chance at a top 4 pick. No lottery discourages tanking.    \n\n\nAs you can see, a no lottery system doesn't really affect the most egregious tankers, but it does limit tanking for teams in the 5-15 range. This pretty much mirrors what we see in the NFL. Someone might disagree with which teams would continue to tank in a new hypothetical system, but hopefully we can agree there's logic to eliminating the Lottery.   \n\nWhat do you think?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qxuty6", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "mathis4losers", "score": 0, "comments": 31, "created_utc": 1770414069.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770697122, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "d66193e13517e56311de1b625e40995171670946", "source": "reddit", "title": "Someone smarter than me explain Kyle Filipowski", "body": "With the Jaren Jackson Jr trade it seems like there is no future for Filipowski with the Jazz.

But I see people either say he is an elite scorer and rising, or others say he is an inneficent complete ball stopper. So I wanted to explore a bit of whether Cam Thomas is an elite scorer or not.\n\nDisclaimer: I am a casual NBA fan, and I only watched 7-9 games of Cam Thomas, so this evaluation is extremely surface level.\n\nTo me, Cam Thomas isn't an elite scorer, he's a great shot maker, meaning he can make almost any kind of shot out there and it has a chance of going in The reason why I don't believe he is an elite scorer is that, to me, elite scorers have many different counters and answers to different defensive looks and sort of have a conceptual flow chart when they have the ball in their hand and can use athletic or fundamental advantages to get easier shots. And as a result, they can force the defense to adjust to them. For example, people like Kobe or SGA have several different answers to a multitude of defensive situations and counters within counters for the defense, while keeping things simple and leaning into tougher shots later in the shot clock or in the game when their teams need it.\n\nWhen I look at Cam Thomas, he can hit tough shots and get hot instantly, but his scoring ability is more limited due to his physicals and his height. He can get to his spots like the elbow or the key, but he has to work hard in order to get there and expend more energy than other scorers. And he doesn't have effective counters to what the defense is doing. As a result of this, he isn't great at generating space, and he tries beat the defense with his shotmaking ability, which leads to more difficult shots and less efficiency.  [Example 1](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;GameID=0022500704&amp;PlayerID=1630560&amp;Season=2025-26&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=&amp;flag=3&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game), [Example 2](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;GameID=0022500694&amp;PlayerID=1630560&amp;Season=2025-26&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=&amp;flag=3&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game).\n\nFor example, outside of shooting or driving, when he is open, if he can't drive to the basket, he would either step back for a mid-range get to the key for a floater/pull-up shot, or go all the way to the basket for a layup. He has more options/ reads than im giving him credit for when it comes to scoring, but my point is that his options are either not available or not effective once the inital reads are taken away.\n\nHe also doesn't have great size, elite handles, great shooting, or rim gravity, so he has to work extra hard just to create shots himself. He isn't much of a threat to defenses and they can defend these options without worrying about effective counters so as a result he can get easy buckets vs bad defenders or small defenders and can score well early in a season but once teams scout him or get closer to the playoffs the difficulty of his shots go up exponentially where his shot difficulty can be a 5 or 6/10 to a 8 or 9/10 which he can hit but not at enough of a rate for the shot to be effiecent in the first place. \n\nWhere Cam Thomas is at his best, in my opinion, is in early offense or transition and off the ball. Where he can start off with an advantage, where he can simplify his game, get to his spots easier, and reduce the difficulty of his shots, although his ceiling on these looks is not high especially this season, the efficiency for these looks has been lower than in 2023-24 and 24-25 [Cam Thomas | Guard | Brooklyn Nets | NBA.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1630560/shots-dash). He can use these situations to build a better foundation for scoring and increase his efficiency.\n\nI don’t believe that Cam Thomas is a ball hog. In my opinion, he's a willing passer, but he isn't consistently good at more complex reads. For example, if he is in the pick and roll or getting doubled, he will have issues locating the open man. Also, since he's on a bad team, he needs to get something going for the offense, and that means his shot selection can be wild at times to generate offense to make up for the lack of creation Brooklyn already has.\n\nAs a result, I don't think he is an elite scorer, he just doesn't have the tools that guys like Kyrie, SGA, Kobe, or Allen Iverson have to keep the defense on its heels. To me hes a microwave scorer and an elite shotmaker. He is sort of like a quarterback who thrives off one read, but when that read is taken away or limited, his efficiency goes down.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qx2c0f", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Comer_Agua", "score": 66, "comments": 100, "created_utc": 1770336769.0, "mode": "hot", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770697123, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "e7024f28a5e6d6eff15ac51e5621e791c91d467b", "source": "reddit", "title": "Post Game Thread - NBA: The Nets defeat the Bulls on Feb 9, 2026, the final score is 123-115.", "body": "This post contains content not supported on old Reddit.

They’d have to trade Jabari smith which they could do but he and Eason are basically the same caliber and will get paid the same.

That's pretty much how it goes for us. We play to get more possessions with a shot off than other teams - be it through gambling for steals, getting blocks, or getting offensive rebounds all while getting out on the break. That is why we lead the league in fouls per game and why we are finding success despite being 20th in three point percentage. Turns out that more scoring opportunities mean something and I think we are trying to shift the meta. Will this style that finds success in the playoffs? I'm not sure. However Trajan Langdon is going to let it ride and use the playoffs to evaluate our long term needs after electing to hold off on making any big splashes at the trade deadline. Our fanbase is hopeful that Jalen Duren's right knee injury is just a minor setback for him, but it did knock him out of the dunk contest at All-Star weekend already. In other news, we converted the best two-way player of all time, Danis Jenkins, to a 2 year team option standard contract. \t|\n2\t|\t[](/OKC) Thunder\t|\t-1\t|\t40-13\t|\tAfter finally getting a couple solid wins off, our final bastion of success has fallen. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has strained his abdomen, and as a result the Thunder offense has and will plummet off a cliff. The only silver lining is that despite a skeleton crew of players being available, we played the Spurs and Rockets in two very close and surprisingly competitive games - almost such that it felt like wins? Looking forward, it seems JDub might be back today, and the all star break is the following week. And in a very bright and unexpected turn - it seems Topic is gonna start getting minutes in the G-League which would be part of his ramp up to finally play in the NBA after his battle with cancer. All to say: the Thunder _should_ be healthy after the ASB with guys like SGA, Jdub, and Mitchell all returning after extended breaks and with the potential addition of Topic - should improve OKC's ball handling a million times. ALSO WE GOT JARED MCCAIN LOL\t|\n3\t|\t[](/SAS) Spurs\t|\t--\t|\t36-16\t|\tStephon mf Castle, ladies and gentlemen. After nursing some injuries and even coming off the bench on a minutes restriction, Castle made history last Saturday night as the third-youngest player with a 40 point triple double behind LeBron and Luka, and the only other player in *NBA history* other than *Wilt Chamberlain* to record a 40 point triple double with &gt;75% shooting from the field. Debatably cherry picked, but when you're on a list by yourself with Wilt (or on another list with LeBron and Luka), you've done something damn impressive. Overall, while the Spurs still have the occasionally frustrating game, the team is handling the doldrums of the pre-ASB season pretty well--they're building a solid, if not necessarily safe, gap between themselves and the rest of the West for the 2 seed, the Spurs will be represented in every event at All Star weekend except for the 3 Point Contest (including by Mitch and our coaching staff!), and Wemby's been healthy and seems to have his minutes restriction fully removed at this point. The Rodeo Road Trip officially starts this week, but the ASB and Austin games will help break it up to more manageable levels than it's been in previous years (fingers crossed to the new stadium permanently ending the arrangement). The Spurs have @LAL, @GSW, ASB, PHO (Austin), SAC (Austin), @DET over the next two weeks.\t|\n4\t|\t[](/NYK) Knicks\t|\t+4\t|\t34-19\t|\tEl Bembé has arrived, and not a moment too soon as McBride gets put on ice until spring. Knicks have recovered strongly from prior losing, dropping only one shorthanded clunker to Detroit in the past ten. We're a top 2 team in net rating over the past couple weeks, and wins against Denver and Boston have helped the vibes tremendously. \t|\n5\t|\t[](/BOS) Celtics\t|\t+1\t|\t34-19\t|\tWhat a trade deadline. Not only did the Celtics swap Aferno Simons for Vucci Mane, but they managed to trade away Chris Boucher, Xavier Tillman Sr, and Josh Minott which got them under the apron *and* reset the timer on their massive TPE which is now at 27.68 million. While it seemed like many fans were hesitant to celebrate bringing in Vucevic due to his age and lack of any semblance of defense, his two games so far have been pretty great. Since the last rankings the Celtics have gone 6-2, with victories over the Trailblazers, Kings, Bucks, Mavericks, Rockets, and Heat, as well as losses to the Knicks and Hawks. Between now and the next rankings the Celtics will play only three times, but good lord what a three game stretch. They face the Bulls in what will be Simons return game immediately after getting traded. Then they'll face the Warriors in a game where Porzingis is expected to make his return, meaning the Celtics could face a frontcourt with Horford and Porzingis. Then they'll go play the Lakers and LeBron where if he were to retire this offseason, would be his last game against the Celtics. Completely unrelated, but I discovered my 10 year old nephew has been playing Strat-O-Matic baseball and it sent me down a rabbit hole into finding out they also have Strat-O-Matic football, hockey, and basketball. Sadly they don't currently sell practically any season pre-2017 for the NBA and the resell market has people asking for $500+ for old seasons, but they randomly have the 1998-99 season available and I'm hella tempted to buy it. \t|\n6\t|\t[](/DEN) Nuggets\t|\t-2\t|\t34-19\t|\tAnother week, another 4-6 week injury to add to the Hospital Nugs lineup, this time taking up and comer Peyton Watson out of commission. The Nuggets were able to break their 3-game skid with a comfortable win in Chicago, with a much needed break just around the corner. Oh, and Big Honey just passed the Big O in career triple doubles in his age 30 season, no big deal.\t|\n7\t|\t[](/HOU) Rockets\t|\t-2\t|\t32-19\t|\t\t|\n8\t|\t[](/CLE) Cavaliers\t|\t+2\t|\t32-21\t|\tThe Cavs went 5-1 in this stretch and now have the best record in the NBA since the start of 2026, with Jarrett Allen playing at an all star level in this stretch, putting up 22/11/3 over the last 5 games. When Jarrett Allen gets involved offensively, this team looks like it’s on another level: he’s got incredible footwork and a soft touch around the rim, along with sticky hands that reel in passes on the pick and roll as well as anyone I’ve ever seen. It’s easy to forgot how good Jarrett Allen is offensively when hardly gets double digit FGA in a game. The deadline saw us move our longest tenured player in Darius Garland for what is hopefully more than a rental in James Harden, while sending off Lonzo Ball for cap space, and De’Andre Hunter and Lonzo Ball for Keon Ellis and Dennis Schroder. We’ve lacked point of attack defense after trading Okoro for Ball, and we’ve lacked bench scoring from the guard position after not re-signing Ty Jerome, which Hunter for Ellis/Schroder directly addresses. The trades saved ~$100m in luxury tax payments, but the Cavs failed to get out of the second apron. Altman will be sitting in the hot seat if these trades don't lead to better results than we've gotten.\t|\n9\t|\t[](/MIN) TWolves\t|\t+2\t|\t32-22\t|\tThere is not a team in the nba that needs the all star break more than the Wolves. Not for the normal injury reasons but just to get away and refocus on the goals set before the season. Despite making some needed moves to the roster the team is just lifeless and lazy. \t|\n10\t|\t[](/LAL) Lakers\t|\t+2\t|\t32-19\t|\t\t|\n11\t|\t[](/TOR) Raptors\t|\t-4\t|\t32-22\t|\tThey keep blowing games man. Darko my guy some of this is on you. I hope they can get over the hump because the Raptor's play brililantly for 3 quarters at times just to blow it. Off of the top of my head, blown leads to Charlotte, La Clippers, New York, Orlando, and Minnessota. I know every team blows leads now and then, but damn a few wins out of those games would have had us 2nd in the East. \t|\n12\t|\t[](/PHX) Suns\t|\t-3\t|\t31-22\t|\tISHBIA HAS DONE IT! THE IMPOSSIBLE HAS HAPPENED! AT AGE 42... I mean, WE DIDN'T GO ALL IN AT THE DEADLINE! Not that I expected we would, but it's nice after years of big moves to have an established and *⋆｡°✩aligned✩°｡⋆* team that is a joy to watch instead of betting everything on some big name journeyman to fix everything. Speaking of that team, they've hit their projected win total of 30.5 before the trade deadline. We also have a better record that the 2023, 2024, and 2025 Suns at this point in the season. Three \"championship\" contenders. Now if we can actually get healthy for more than 2 games in a row, that would be nice...\t|\n13\t|\t[](/PHI) 76ers\t|\t--\t|\t30-22\t|\t\t|\n14\t|\t[](/CHA) Hornets\t|\t+8\t|\t25-28\t|\tFuck every single one of you who doubted LaMelo Ball and said he was a losing player. 14-1 with this starting lineup. Top 3 net rating over 25 games which is over HALF the season. 9 game winning streak. Apologize and admit you were wrong about him and the Hornets. We're coming for the playoffs and I think we can make some noise\t|\n15\t|\t[](/GSW) Warriors\t|\t-1\t|\t28-25\t|\tThe Tingus Pingus trade at deadline set Kuminga free. An abrupt end to the Giannis pursuit with minimal satisfaction. On paper this team has potential for *this* year IF all healthy but Jimmy is out for at least this year and most of next and this team is OLD. The Warriors future success as a contender with Steph is dim and the reality of a post-Steph Warriors is sinking in.\t|\n16\t|\t[](/MIA) Heat\t|\t--\t|\t28-26\t|\tI don't have much to say this week. The trade deadline broke me and many other Heat fans. Just pure confusion. Years in a row stuck in the play-in with zero roster moves whatsoever. We haven't even cut Rozier yet, despite the fact that he's an expiring... we literally could sign somebody right now if we just cut him. I'm not sure what the front office is up to and it's hard to keep faith right now. Good news is that Jakucionas and Ware both had huge games last night. The young guns look bright, it would be great if Spo would just force-feed them minutes, but we know that's not how he works. As for the team, we just look mid right now, and I don't see much changing post-All-Star. The only thing I'm looking forward to is seeing how much better Jakucionas and Ware will get as the season goes on. \t|\n17\t|\t[](/ORL) Magic\t|\t--\t|\t27-24\t|\tHot damn do we look inconsistent as hell night after night. Strong showings against the Heat and Nets, comeback wins against the Raptors and the tanking Jazz but then absolute shitshows against the Cavs twice, Thunder and Spurs. Only Franz is still out so you can't even really blame injuries all that much anymore, unless you believe Franz to be the second coming. Roughly 30 games left, no first round pick this year and solidly in a play-in spot with a chance to jump a few spots really gives the Magic just one option the rest of the season: deep playoff run or bust. In either case, most likely Mose is out as head coach. The roster seem to have started to tune him out, giving inconsistent effort on defense and just continuing to be overall inept on offense. Trade deadline was par the course in the Weltman era, trading Tyus Jones to shed salary and get under the luxury tax, and signing Jevon Carter to be a depth guard the rest of the season. Oh and Jase Richardson is following in his father's footsteps, participating in the Slam Dunk contest as a rookie. The only representation at All-Star Weekend so hopefully the rest of the guys can get some rest, mentally reset and get ready for the second half of the season.\t|\n18\t|\t[](/LAC) Clippers\t|\t-3\t|\t25-27\t|\tFirst and foremost, nothing but the best of luck to both James Harden and Ivica Zubac on their new teams. Thank you for being consistent positive presences on the Clippers, it is incredibly sad and startling to see all this happen so soon but most Clips fans agree that it was probably best to prepare for the next couple of seasons however we can. For this current season, however, we'll have to wait a couple of weeks to see it at full strength. Both Benny Math and Isaiah Jackson will probably get their debuts in the upcoming week, but Darius Garland probably won't be seen until after the ASB. All 3 will be welcome additions as the team hopes to stay competitive in the West. Kawhi, despite losing his starting guard and big man in the space of 48 hours, has continued to be an All-NBA level player, righting the ship of our offense singlehandedly until we get Garland in the mix. All us Clips fans can hope now is that we keep the fight out of the play-in spots going as we await the results of the draft lottery for the first time in a while.\t|\n19\t|\t[](/ATL) Hawks\t|\t+1\t|\t26-28\t|\tSo, the Hawks had a very busy deadline. The Hawks made 4 trades the week of the deadline, and all of them were rather interesting (for different reasons). The one thing that they all had in common was that they signaled that Onsi and the front office is focused on the future more so than the present. All in all, the Hawks have taken ~$34m off of their books for next season and gained 3 2RPs. I assume that the specifics of what the team ends up doing will heavily depend on where teh Pels/Bucks pick lands in the lottery, but no matter what Onsi is certainly maintaining optionality. ...I feel like there's something else to talk about... Oh yeah! The actual players we got! Jock Landale gives us another serviceable big man in the rotation, and Kuminga gives us a second player that can be physical and drive to the rim behind Jalen. Hield can provide some shooting, and I guess Vincent can give us vibes? Yeah, those last two aren't likely going to get many minutes, but at least they can provide some depth in case of injury. Atlanta now has 13 players that I'm comfortable getting play time, a notable improvement from a few weeks ago when we only had 11 (and one of those was a continuously injured Kristaps).\t|\n20\t|\t[](/POR) Trail Blazers\t|\t-2\t|\t25-28\t|\tPortland has missed more player-games than any team in the league, the the burden of those injuries are starting to pile up. The loss of Deni Avdija, who was recently named as a first-time all-star, has been particularly difficult to recover from. On the bright side, recently addition Vit Krejci has added some much needed shooting. Scoot Henderson has also looked very good considering how much time he missed. \t|\n21\t|\t[](/MIL) Bucks\t|\t+3\t|\t21-29\t|\tTold ya Giannis wasn't going anywhere mid-season. Getting Osumene Dieng and Cam Thomas entirely for free is pretty cool -- maybe one of them can be something for us. But at this point, I'm at peace with either tanking or sneaking into the play-ins, both could help prepare us for a huge offseason in different ways. \t|\n22\t|\t[](/CHI) Bulls\t|\t-3\t|\t24-29\t|\tOops, All Guards! We have finally committed to the tank, but still fucked it up. No 1sts, all 2nds, and zero bigs. But at least this tank is gonna be a fun tank. It's awesome watching Simons, Ivey, and Yabusele ball out. I like that we're focusing on developing our young players, and really spreading out the minutes so everybody has a shot at playing. I'm very curious how Giddey is gonna fit into this offense once he's healthy. With the trades, We definitely could've gotten a better return for Coby. I was shocked we didn't get a single first-round pick. The Ayo trade had me falling to my knees in the Burger King restrooms. That shit hurt. I know we got Dillingham, but come on. Ayo IS Chicago. Vuc trade was alright, we fleeced the Knicks for Yabubu, and fleeced Detroit too. I still wish we got some 1sts, but I should expect the Bulls front office to make horrible choices at this point.\t|\n23\t|\t[](/DAL) Mavericks\t|\t-2\t|\t19-33\t|\tIt was a somewhat busy trade deadline for the Mavs, moving a lot of the toxic parts of what represented the Nico era: Anthony Davis, D'Angelo Russell, Dante Exum (he had playoff moments in 2024, but re-signing him instead of OMax doesn't look great in hindsight), and Jaden Hardy were sent to Washington in a near salary dump. The Mavs also got Tyus Jones from Charlotte, and he will help mend the PG hole as Ryan Nembhard gets closer and closer to getting his two-way converted. Bagley had an impressive 16-12 with 4 blocks off the bench in his first game as a Mav on Saturday, so he should get some good reps to showcase his game for his free agency this summer. Dallas kept Gafford, Klay, and Naji Marshall, which makes the summer's trade opportunities interesting for the Mavs as they should by then have a full-time GM.\t|\n24\t|\t[](/MEM) Grizzlies\t|\t-1\t|\t20-31\t|\tALLLLLLL ABOARD!! The team is 100% committed to tank, with 13 picks over the next 7 years, and full ownership of all their own picks, the team has rightfully decided to build around Zach Edey and Cedric Coward as their new foundation. It appears that the best case scenario is we end the season with the 5th worst record, giving us a 42% chance at a top 4 pick. In this draft, that's probably good enough to get an elite player and start the rebuilding process over. The GM Zack Kleiman seems to think this will be a short rebuild, so maybe he knows something the rest of us don't as the team really does need a true #1. Of course, we're assuming Ja Morant is gone this summer. \t|\n25\t|\t[](/UTA) Jazz\t|\t--\t|\t16-37\t|\t\t|\n26\t|\t[](/NOP) Pelicans\t|\t--\t|\t14-40\t|\tThe Pelicans are 4-6 in their last 10. That doesn't sound impressive. But they are also 6-8 in their last 14. Which means they have won almost half their games on the season in the last 30 days. The status is awful but the trend is improving.\t|\n27\t|\t[](/BKN) Nets\t|\t+2\t|\t14-37\t|\tThe rookies are looking good and the Nets ethical tank continues. Nolan Traore and Egor Demin has progressed along nicely as the season has gone one. While the other rooks in Drake Powell, Danny Wolf, and Bern Saraf have their moments, they all have been struggling againt good teams while feasting against the dregs of the league. Development is key though so they will continue to get burn and we saw our first 5 rookie lineup (it did pretty well too) \t|\n28\t|\t[](/IND) Pacers\t|\t-1\t|\t13-40\t|\tIndiana surprisingly made a decently-sized swing at the trade deadline, acquiring center Ivica Zubac from the Clippers. Zubac satisfies a need that has plagued the Pacers for the last several seasons: rebounding. Obviously, it remains to be seen how much of an impact this move will make since all hinges on Tyrese Haliburton's return next season, but Indiana's willingness to make a move at this point signals their faith in Zubac's potential.\t|\n29\t|\t[](/WAS) Wizards\t|\t+1\t|\t14-38\t|\tWashington is officially in there \"First nice apartment after you graduate college move,\" acquiring very nice, expensive furniture for cheap despite the fact the furniture might not fit the style or the room\" era. The goal is to highlight the pieces that you'll actually proud and like -- the awesome couch, the bookshelves you built yourself, a really nice rug. But now, you have an oversized coffee table who's height doesn't line-up with your couch height. You can't be too upset -- it is a vintage coffee table, decently maintained except it keeps getting injured for some reason. It is just going to take time to get the fit to work. Anthony Davis adds another level of credibility to an organization that is desperately searching for it.

ESPN promptly named the Miami Heat, New York Knicks, Minnesota Timberwolves, and Golden State Warriors as potential landing spots. Over the next several days, Giannis trade rumors took over the sports news cycle. Major outlets discussed it seriously, debated fits, and framed it as a real possibility. Yet, as the deadline passed, the two-time MVP remained with the Bucks.\n\n\\&gt; Soon after, Giannis announced that he had taken a partial ownership stake in Kalshi, a prediction-market platform that allows users to bet on real-world outcomes. Kalshi hosts prediction markets on sports, politics, and pretty much anything, even the weather. In the weeks leading up to the deadline, roughly $23 million had been placed on Kalshi markets tied to where Giannis would end up.\n\n\\&gt; The situation presents a clear conflict of interest. Giannis publicly allowed trade speculation to build, and millions of dollars flowed into markets, guessing where he might go. When the deadline passed, he stayed in Milwaukee and also held a partial ownership stake in the platform that hosted those bets. Even without proof of intent, the overlap is hard to ignore. Kalshi’s markets visibly shifted in response to news updates and reporting about Giannis throughout the process.\n\n\\&gt; This concern is not theoretical. Over the past year, gambling scandals have erupted across major sports. In the NBA, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups were arrested in an FBI investigation into illegal sports betting schemes involving organized crime. Yes, that Mafia. In college basketball, federal authorities have revealed widespread point-shaving and match-fixing investigations. The scandal involved 39 players and 17 teams. In Major League Baseball, Cleveland Guardians pitcher Emmanuel Clase was federally indicted on charges including wire fraud, bribery, and conspiracy for allegedly rigging pitches in as many as 48 games.\n\n\\&gt; If we can’t trust the news, the markets, or the motives behind the stories we follow, then what are we actually watching? Sports only work if we believe they are real. Giannis did more than test that belief. He broke it. By tying trade speculation to ownership in a prediction market, he crossed a line that sports have treated as a cardinal sin for generations. It dealt a direct blow to fan trust and to the league’s claim of integrity.\n\n\\&gt; Once fans start asking whether outcomes, stories, and speculation are part of the show, the illusion is already gone. Gambling did not blur the line between performance and reality by accident. It made the blur profitable. And once uncertainty itself becomes the product, trust is no longer the foundation of sports. It becomes the wager.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r08lua", "subreddit": "nba", "author": "mastermind208", "score": 8912, "comments": 844, "created_utc": 1770654120.0, "mode": "hot", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770697439, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "0af07ee07ddda97e604e98461f1f633522f64619", "source": "reddit", "title": "[Highlight] Duncan Robinson’s reaction to his teammates getting into a serious altercation:", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0ns64", "subreddit": "nba", "author": "YujiDomainExpansion", "score": 1331, "comments": 167, "created_utc": 1770688671.0, "mode": "hot", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770697439, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "f83a63ebe4dfaf0f9e10a7d74d94326cf1a09c04", "source": "reddit", "title": "[Highlight] Pistons &amp; Hornets get into a brawl", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0nolc", "subreddit": "nba", "author": "LaDainianTomIinson", "score": 1296, "comments": 282, "created_utc": 1770688408.0, "mode": "hot", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770697440, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "024c464d17b9115ddd2d338f05742665bd6209af", "source": "reddit", "title": "2025-26 Midseason Player Evaluations: Who are the best players in the NBA?", "body": "Over the last decade I’ve worked in data analytics environments and applied inferential statistical methods both inside and outside basketball contexts. Alongside that, I’ve built and maintained a historical database of graded high-impact NBA player seasons that I use for cross-era evaluation.\n\nAt this point, I’ve graded roughly the top 10–15 players from each of the last \\~40 NBA seasons (≈600 player-seasons total). The goal wasn’t just to build ranking lists, but rather to build a stable impact magnitude scale across eras. I periodically revisit those seasons as my framework improves to keep the scale internally consistent. When I evaluate current players, I’m placing them relative to that historical anchor map rather than evaluating them in isolation.\n\nMethodologically, this sits somewhere between pure modeling and pure scouting. I’m not running a single formula and publishing whatever number comes out. Instead, I use a triangulation process across multiple evidence streams and then map that combined signal onto historically calibrated impact tiers.\n\n# The Core Question\n\nThe central question I’m trying to approximate is:\n\n**What is this player’s intrinsic basketball impact level?**\n\nMore concretely:\n\n**If you added this player to a random NBA team, how much would he increase that team’s probability of winning a championship?**\n\nThis matters because value measured strictly within one team context is heavily influenced by role, roster construction, redundancy, coaching scheme, usage environment, and numerous other factors independent of a player's true level. Two players can generate similar impact signals on one roster while having very different portability across the league as a whole. So, how a player retains his value on different types of teams, not just the one he happens to be on, is important. The goal is to approximate a player’s average impact across many plausible team environments, not just the one he currently happens to be in.\n\n# How I Approximate That\n\nThe evaluation is a synthesis of several signal layers:\n\n**Impact metrics**  \nRAPM-family signals, possession-value box models, lineup and on/off data. These provide directional and magnitude signal but are always interpreted in context.\n\n**Film and mechanism evaluation**  \nFilm helps determine how impact is being generated and how likely it is to translate across defensive schemes and playoff environments.\n\n**Multi-year signal stabilization**  \nSingle-season spikes are treated cautiously unless supported by mechanism and historical precedent. To avoid drowning in statistical noise, it's important to use evidence from surrounding seasons to inform this season's valuation.\n\n**Contextual Factors**  \nSome skill packages historically maintain impact more consistently across team constructions, matchups, and playoff environments. Three big questions here: (1) how well does a player retain his value when paired with other high level teammates, and how well does he allow them to retain their value? (2) how well does a player's portfolio of skills translate to the style of play we see in playoff environments? (3) what other contextual factors (role, team construction, coaching, redundancies or lack thereof) might be inflating or suppressing the metrics beyond what we'd see from the player on a random team?\n\n**Historical calibration**  \nMy 600-season database is used to anchor magnitude. New seasons are placed relative to known historical impact clusters.\n\n# Midseason Context\n\nThese are midseason point estimates. I will calculate the final season version after the playoffs wrap up, and this will include explicit uncertainty ranges.\n\nAt this point in the season, tier placement and broad ordering tend to stabilize earlier than exact magnitude. Midseason estimates are anchored to prior full-season calibrated levels and adjusted based on current-season evidence so far.\n\n# Interpretive Scale for Net Valuations\n\n7.0+ → GOAT-level peak (≈ top 2–3 peaks ever)  \n6.0+ → All-time great peak (≈ top \\~10 peaks ever)  \n5.4–6.0 → Strong MVP level  \n4.6–5.4 → Solid MVP level  \n4.0–4.6 → Weak MVP level  \n3.0+ → Solid All-NBA level  \n1.5+ → All-Star level\n\nImpact estimates are (roughly) measured in points per game of impact contribution to a random team, adjusted to calibrate the proxy to added championship probability.\n\n# 2025–26 Midseason Snapshot\n\n\\~14 players considered for this exercise as candidates for the top 10 spots; assumes full health\n\n* format: Player X (point estimates for impact: OFF, DEF, NET)\n\n# Locks\n\nNikola Jokic — (6.2, 0.2, 6.4)  \nShai Gilgeous-Alexander — (5.0, 0.6, 5.6)  \nGiannis Antetokounmpo — (3.5, 1.4, 4.9)  \nVictor Wembanyama — (1.7, 3.0, 4.7)  \nStephen Curry — (4.4, -0.2, 4.2)\n\n# Near Locks / Very Strong Candidates\n\nLuka Doncic — (4.0, -0.3, 3.7)  \nKawhi Leonard — (3.1, 0.5, 3.6)  \nCade Cunningham — (2.9, 0.7, 3.6)\n\n# Remaining Candidates\n\n(Heavy confidence interval overlap, difficult to cleanly rank)\n\nTyrese Maxey — (3.3, 0.0, 3.3)  \nJalen Brunson — (3.6, -0.4, 3.2)  \nJamal Murray — (3.4, -0.3, 3.1)  \nAnthony Edwards — (2.7, 0.4, 3.1)  \nJaylen Brown — (2.8, 0.3, 3.1)  \nDonovan Mitchell — (3.3, -0.3, 3.0)\n\n— Top-10 candidate line —\n\nIf forced to add one more today:  \nChet Holmgren — (0.5, 2.3, 2.8)\n\nHappy to answer questions about methodology or discuss specific players.

That is, unless you go deep in the playoffs or even win a championship. This is the thesis statement for tanking. And honestly, no clever trick or interesting rule has changed or will change that. If winning becomes a positive value, then you obviously have a positive feedback loop where good teams get value and losing teams lose value. As a result, any plan to fix tanking by making tanking less favorable will automatically make the balancing function between good and bad teams weaker, which is an essential aspect of the parity in the sport.\n\nSo for any solution, it seems like there are two major ways to truly end tanking: take wins and losses out of the equation or give the worst teams some assets that are more valuable on truly bad teams than they are on teams that are pretending to be bad. An extreme example of the former is literally why having a committee that decides who are truly the worst teams, factoring in sketchy tactics, strength of schedule, basically the reverse college sports ranking system and have that decide the lottery. The latter is a bit difficult to pin down. Ultimately, everybody needs talent. Good teams need talent. Bad teams need talent. Trade or salary exemptions are pretty important for everybody. Maybe something that can give teams more dart throws of talent? Like some eased restrictions or exceptions on trades that return more players than it sends for the teams at the bottom of the standings? This is definitely something that would need more thoughts.\n\nI'm not really positing a specific rule change to eliminate tanking, but I feel like I see a lot of threads that fall into the two obvious traps of neither actually flipping the script on wins having a significant negative value to non-contenders nor avoiding a situation where the worst teams stay losing.\n\nLet me know what you all think!", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qzujwb", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Round-Walrus3175", "score": 64, "comments": 45, "created_utc": 1770611234.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770697440, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "b1e25b1934887c7b5269b6f4d96b5c2df931fc58", "source": "reddit", "title": "I don’t get the hate for “tanking” and ultimately it gives the NBA more parity than any other sports league (of the big 4 in America.)", "body": "I see a lot of people trying to come up with solutions to prevent tanking (purposely throwing games to get a higher overall pick.) \n\nIn the moment it sort of sucks if you follow a team day in and day out knowing they’re going to lose. But it’s the same thing if they genuinely suck. But it’s better for the NBA to have a team that’s mediocre tank to become competitive than a team that’s outright terrible year after year. \n\nCompare it to other sports. In the NFL there’s no lottery. The worst team gets the first pick. Yet, the same few teams dominate every year. Since 2011 every AFC championship game has had either the Patriots or Chiefs in it. I think coaching and general management/ownership impacts winning more than talent in the NFL. The best player in NFL history was a 6th overall pick. \n\nMatthew Stafford was a first overall pick and didn’t win squat with the Lions. Traded to the Rams and within a few seasons has a Super Bowl ring and MVP. All because he’s coached by an elite offensive coach. If you have bad ownership and bad coaching  you can have all the talent imaginable and you won’t win anything. The Jets, Browns, Raiders, etc.  \n\nNow look at the MLB. The Dodgers are well on their way to winning a third consecutive championship. And they’d have even more if they didn’t get screwed by cheaters in the WS back to back years in 2017 and 2018. Basically the rest of the teams are competing to be either the 2nd best NL team or for an American League pennant. The only team in recent memory that succeeded in tanking is the Astros and they cheated for one of their two championships. Teams that suck in baseball suck because their owners are penny pinchers. Even if they get elite draft picks they’ll just be traded or signed to a mega deal by a World Series contender once their contract is over. Paul Skenes is a good example. \n\nSure there’s “dynasties” in the NBA but nothing compared to the NFL, for example. The Warriors are the latest example. But Steph Curry only has 4 rings and has been playing since 2009. Mahomes already has 3 super bowls and started playing in 2018. \n\nPeople complain about tanking but will wear the jersey of the super star they wound up getting in the draft and when they win the championship they’ll forget their team even did it. People were up in arms over the Luka trade last year and the Mavs wound up getting Cooper Flagg because of it. And Luka hasn’t done anything with the Lakers. \n\n“It’s not fair to the fans that pay for tickets to see stars get pulled.”\n\nNot a real argument in a league that has random rest days and load management even for the elite teams. And if the team they paid to see sucks they only spent less than $50 for good seats on a ticket anyways. Total crapshoot on who you’re going to see play on any given day. \n\nWhy would owners risk whatever star players they have getting injured in ultimately meaningless games? Even if they don’t win because of the top overall pick, the revenue and ticket sales they get the following season are well worth it.\n\nAnd if you genuinely think tanking sucks, what’s the fix? You already have a lottery system. You want a play in tournament for the first few picks? Good luck getting owners and players to agree to play in even more games when they had to make rules to give the MVP to a player that plays most of the season. \n\nEvery suggestion I’ve seen has been terrible. A bunch of them are asinine like why don’t we take all the eligible players in the draft and put their names in a hat and have a team representative pick blindfolded and that’s the player they get.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qz8tjr", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "wetcornbread", "score": 0, "comments": 47, "created_utc": 1770557052.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770697441, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "222d9bd6258d05ef31fae78ccd5ba54e183f0436", "source": "reddit", "title": "Why has NBA fandom become more about rings than enjoying regular-season basketball?", "body": "I’ve been thinking about this for a while, and I’m genuinely confused about why NBA fandom has become so ring-obsessed that it almost ignores the product most fans actually consume.\n\nMost fans are not front-office analysts. We’re not running championship probability models or thinking in terms of “windows.” We’re people who live in a city, buy tickets, and plan weekends around games. For us, the regular season isn’t filler, it is the product.\n\nTake the recent Cleveland Cavaliers teams. They’ve had strong regular-season records, a clear identity, young talent, and they play competitive basketball most nights. The arena is engaged, the team feels alive, and fans have something to look forward to week after week. From a fan-experience standpoint, that feels like success.\n\nOr take the Giannis-led Milwaukee Bucks over multiple seasons. Even outside the championship year, those teams consistently won a lot of regular-season games, had stars playing most nights, and gave local fans a high-quality product across the year. Yet even with that, seasons that ended short of a deep playoff run were quickly reframed as disappointments or failures.\n\nThat disconnect is what bothers me.\n\nA 50-win team that plays hard, has continuity, and gives fans meaningful games for 6–7 months is now treated as “stuck” or “useless” if it doesn’t make a conference finals or Finals. Front offices respond by dismantling good, watchable teams in the name of chasing a title that only one team wins anyway.\n\nFrom a fan perspective, that logic feels broken.\n\nThe parade lasts one day.\n\nThe season lasts eight months.\n\nWhy should I, as someone who actually attends games and watches weekly, accept a worse regular-season product now for a hypothetical payoff later? Why should I be happy with stars sitting, effort being managed, or teams pivoting toward tanking, all so the franchise can say it “maximized its championship odds”?\n\nWhat makes this worse is how ring culture trains fans to think like executives instead of fans. We stop asking “Was that a good basketball game?” and start asking “Does this translate in the playoffs?” We start defending decisions that make the regular season less enjoyable because media narratives tell us anything short of a title is meaningless.\n\nBut that framing benefits front offices, media debates, and legacy arguments, not the people in the arena on a random Friday night.\n\nEven good teams aren’t allowed to just be good anymore. If you’re not a championship team, you’re expected to either blow it up or radically reshape, which leads to endless cycles of rebuilding, short contention windows, and little continuity. The result is a league where your favorite team is either all-in for a ring or bad at everything else, with very little space for sustained, enjoyable competitiveness.\n\nI’m not saying championships don’t matter. Of course they do. But when the pursuit of rings starts devaluing the majority of games fans actually watch, something feels off.\n\nWhy can’t the default goal be: play hard, be competitive, build continuity, and give fans something to enjoy every other week, and if a championship eventually comes, great? Why does everything have to be judged only at the very end?\n\nGenuinely curious: at what point did NBA fandom stop being about enjoying basketball and start being about auditing legacies?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qyhs5k", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Kitchen_Pomegranate7", "score": 251, "comments": 150, "created_utc": 1770480723.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770697441, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "0d512964aa31462fb8a0addb07984f8b92970a37", "source": "reddit", "title": "Did big men stop being skilled in the 2010s, or were they just as skilled in the previous eras, but made obsolete by stretch bigs", "body": "Many 90s fans call their era the golden age of big men.

The chance at a #1 pick basically incentivizes every team to be as worse as possible. Let's look at the current tankathon.com rankings and the teams that own their own picks and might tank:   \n\n\n1: Sacramento: Obviously they would still tank if there's no lottery.  \n\n3. Indiana: I don't think Indiana wants to tank and I don't think getting rid of the lottery would change anything.    \n\n4. Brooklyn: They would continue to tank in either system.    \n\n5-6: Was, Utah: Both teams need to keep their pick, so they would tank in either system. However, because the lottery potentially drops their ranking, it encourages them to be worse than just 8.    \n\n7-9: Dallas, Memphis, Milwaukee: I think without a lottery system, these teams would not have any chance to break into the top 4. I don't think tanking for positioning between picks 7-11 is worth it. I think they'd compete harder if there was no lottery.   \n\n12-13: Chicago, Charlotte: Being in the lottery gives these teams incentive to stay there. No lottery would limit tanking.     \n\n15. Miami: Again, depending on how things go, they might.  benefit from breaking into the lottery and getting a chance at a top 4 pick. No lottery discourages tanking.    \n\n\nAs you can see, a no lottery system doesn't really affect the most egregious tankers, but it does limit tanking for teams in the 5-15 range. This pretty much mirrors what we see in the NFL. Someone might disagree with which teams would continue to tank in a new hypothetical system, but hopefully we can agree there's logic to eliminating the Lottery.   \n\nWhat do you think?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qxuty6", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "mathis4losers", "score": 0, "comments": 31, "created_utc": 1770414069.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770697442, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "15cb0a029f3431a28e86dea0236d95a6d5749fc9", "source": "reddit", "title": "Someone smarter than me explain Kyle Filipowski", "body": "With the Jaren Jackson Jr trade it seems like there is no future for Filipowski with the Jazz.

But I see people either say he is an elite scorer and rising, or others say he is an inneficent complete ball stopper. So I wanted to explore a bit of whether Cam Thomas is an elite scorer or not.\n\nDisclaimer: I am a casual NBA fan, and I only watched 7-9 games of Cam Thomas, so this evaluation is extremely surface level.\n\nTo me, Cam Thomas isn't an elite scorer, he's a great shot maker, meaning he can make almost any kind of shot out there and it has a chance of going in The reason why I don't believe he is an elite scorer is that, to me, elite scorers have many different counters and answers to different defensive looks and sort of have a conceptual flow chart when they have the ball in their hand and can use athletic or fundamental advantages to get easier shots. And as a result, they can force the defense to adjust to them. For example, people like Kobe or SGA have several different answers to a multitude of defensive situations and counters within counters for the defense, while keeping things simple and leaning into tougher shots later in the shot clock or in the game when their teams need it.\n\nWhen I look at Cam Thomas, he can hit tough shots and get hot instantly, but his scoring ability is more limited due to his physicals and his height. He can get to his spots like the elbow or the key, but he has to work hard in order to get there and expend more energy than other scorers. And he doesn't have effective counters to what the defense is doing. As a result of this, he isn't great at generating space, and he tries beat the defense with his shotmaking ability, which leads to more difficult shots and less efficiency.  [Example 1](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;GameID=0022500704&amp;PlayerID=1630560&amp;Season=2025-26&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=&amp;flag=3&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game), [Example 2](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;GameID=0022500694&amp;PlayerID=1630560&amp;Season=2025-26&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=&amp;flag=3&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game).\n\nFor example, outside of shooting or driving, when he is open, if he can't drive to the basket, he would either step back for a mid-range get to the key for a floater/pull-up shot, or go all the way to the basket for a layup. He has more options/ reads than im giving him credit for when it comes to scoring, but my point is that his options are either not available or not effective once the inital reads are taken away.\n\nHe also doesn't have great size, elite handles, great shooting, or rim gravity, so he has to work extra hard just to create shots himself. He isn't much of a threat to defenses and they can defend these options without worrying about effective counters so as a result he can get easy buckets vs bad defenders or small defenders and can score well early in a season but once teams scout him or get closer to the playoffs the difficulty of his shots go up exponentially where his shot difficulty can be a 5 or 6/10 to a 8 or 9/10 which he can hit but not at enough of a rate for the shot to be effiecent in the first place. \n\nWhere Cam Thomas is at his best, in my opinion, is in early offense or transition and off the ball. Where he can start off with an advantage, where he can simplify his game, get to his spots easier, and reduce the difficulty of his shots, although his ceiling on these looks is not high especially this season, the efficiency for these looks has been lower than in 2023-24 and 24-25 [Cam Thomas | Guard | Brooklyn Nets | NBA.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1630560/shots-dash). He can use these situations to build a better foundation for scoring and increase his efficiency.\n\nI don’t believe that Cam Thomas is a ball hog. In my opinion, he's a willing passer, but he isn't consistently good at more complex reads. For example, if he is in the pick and roll or getting doubled, he will have issues locating the open man. Also, since he's on a bad team, he needs to get something going for the offense, and that means his shot selection can be wild at times to generate offense to make up for the lack of creation Brooklyn already has.\n\nAs a result, I don't think he is an elite scorer, he just doesn't have the tools that guys like Kyrie, SGA, Kobe, or Allen Iverson have to keep the defense on its heels. To me hes a microwave scorer and an elite shotmaker.

They got assets (2nd round picks, buy-low bets on Ivey Dillingham) for expiring players, and you shake up a roster that wasn’t cutting it and perhaps critically, they didn’t take on long term money. But without getting any 1s or blue chip young players in return…\n\nBut what if this an intermediate step for bigger moves this summer when my understanding is the bulls will have the most cap space in the league by far…\n\nTh FA class is kind of meh….

They’d have to trade Jabari smith which they could do but he and Eason are basically the same caliber and will get paid the same. And we know they need guards. \n\nMeanwhile that’s not an outrageous number for a guy who is improving, heading into his prime, plays two-wall ball, etc.\n\nThere will be competition for him from other teams, but most teams don’t like to sign RFAs to offer sheets bc it ties up your cap room while the other team decides whether or not to match…. But the bulls have so much cap room that it doesn’t matter to them…they can tie up space and still sign deals.\n\nThe bulls could conceivably sign Eason, Peyton Watson (Denver has no space to match an offer) and a center (mark Williams or walker Kessler)to offer sheets… Watson would be in the 25m range same as Eason, while Williams would be cheaper.  \n\nMaybe you get one of them, maybe more. \n\nA lineup of Giddey, Watson, Matas, Eason, Smith w Jones, Okoro, etc off the bench would be pretty damn fun.\n\nPlus bulls would still have all their picks, essengue coming back, etc etc \n\nI know, it’s a super optimistic take and a lot would have to go right, but hey let’s dream a little bit", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qzg0g6", "subreddit": "chicagobulls", "author": "wesley-mann", "score": 10, "comments": 79, "created_utc": 1770574001.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770697445, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "2bd8aa3bb56fdee651a3809e824a86477d971df1", "source": "reddit", "title": "Tank Update: Bulls move into sole possession of the 10th best lotto odds (13.9% top 4 / 3% top 1)", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qze2zn", "subreddit": "chicagobulls", "author": "Sure-Visual-8411", "score": 139, "comments": 124, "created_utc": 1770569734.0, "mode": "hot", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770697445, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "2989a66ddff4d1b32082bf31e00089c4ef79012b", "source": "reddit", "title": "At the game tonight", "body": "Kid sitting behind the scorers table was wearing this at the game against the Nuggets tonight.

(Or something similar--\"most wins after losing their 41st game\", for example.)    \n\nAll the other fixes I've seen--some form of punishing teams for losing on purpose--avoid the real problem, which is that, under the current setup, it's indisputably better for teams to lose games after they've been eliminated from the playoffs.     \n\nUnder my fix, this instantly goes away...while still giving us a system where the best college players will mostly go to the worst NBA teams (which is, broadly, what we want, in terms of parity). Not only does this disincentivize the type of tanking we've seen from the Jazz and Wizards this year (where they are trying to lose games in purpose now), but it also disincentivizes roster constructions like the Process 76ers, where their GM intentionally built a team that was so awful they never had any hope of winning more than a dozen games in a season. (This is disincentivized because if you build a team THAT bad, you're still gonna wind up with a bad draft spot.)         \n\nSome potential downsides, but my responses:       \n\n1) Teams might tank at the START of seasons, rather than the end--basically, speed up the date by which they get eliminated from the 1 seed by tanking in October-January, and THEN, once they're eliminated (or once they've clinched a losing season), THEN start trying to win.       \n\n---I don't think this will actually occur, just because, human nature being what it is, no coach can commit to throwing a season right from the start, every team has that prayer that maybe this year will be different. I also think coaches understand that--again, human nature being what it is--that after spending three months losing on purpose, their team actually WON'T be able to just flip a switch and instantly start trying to win games after the Elimination Date. Those losing habits will become ingrained.   \n\n2) Truly horrible teams will now literally never become better, trapped in a losing cycle forever, now so bad they can never get a #1 draft pick, because--even though they get Eliminated very early on, and have way more opportunities TO win Post-Elimination games and thus improve their positioning in the Draft, they're so bad they just lose all of those games too.         \n\n---One pretty obvious solution to this problem would be that we preserve the lottery system--perhaps one with less randomness than the current one, but still with a luck factor--so, even our hopeless 10-72 team would still have a chance at a number 1 pick. But I mostly just don't think this would be a factor, because it's only the current (flawed) NBA Draft Lottery rules that provide the incentives for teams to go 10 and 72. I just don't think there will be any horrible teams like that--if we fix it to \"Most Post-Elimination Wins\", the Floor automatically gets higher.         \n\n\nWhat do you think?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0t0eg", "subreddit": "nba", "author": "davoarid", "score": 0, "comments": 21, "created_utc": 1770703661.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770708021, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "c00e7c64104cf69909b74ea0be47cfba0060139d", "source": "reddit", "title": "[Highlight] Ant Simons with the Turnaround Fadeaway 3 Against the Double Team", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0swpw", "subreddit": "nba", "author": "BcuzRacecar", "score": 25, "comments": 5, "created_utc": 1770703328.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770708021, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "9eedb05a667a0bf2c5fbfb7158b1640e41835fa1", "source": "reddit", "title": "Russell Westbrook reaches 27,000 career points.", "body": "I don’t see any posts about it but congrats Russ!\n\nHe’s 27 rebounds away from joining the 27k-9k-10k club.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0srev", "subreddit": "nba", "author": "gridironk", "score": 219, "comments": 45, "created_utc": 1770702864.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770708022, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "e57feaa24c288f2026461ad4f3e55be87abd7dea", "source": "reddit", "title": "r/nba Community Home", "body": "This post contains content not supported on old Reddit.

Alongside that, I’ve built and maintained a historical database of graded high-impact NBA player seasons that I use for cross-era evaluation.\n\nAt this point, I’ve graded roughly the top 10–15 players from each of the last \\~40 NBA seasons (≈600 player-seasons total). The goal wasn’t just to build ranking lists, but rather to build a stable impact magnitude scale across eras. I periodically revisit those seasons as my framework improves to keep the scale internally consistent. When I evaluate current players, I’m placing them relative to that historical anchor map rather than evaluating them in isolation.\n\nMethodologically, this sits somewhere between pure modeling and pure scouting. I’m not running a single formula and publishing whatever number comes out. Instead, I use a triangulation process across multiple evidence streams and then map that combined signal onto historically calibrated impact tiers.\n\n# The Core Question\n\nThe central question I’m trying to approximate is:\n\n**What is this player’s intrinsic basketball impact level?**\n\nMore concretely:\n\n**If you added this player to a random NBA team, how much would he increase that team’s probability of winning a championship?**\n\nThis matters because value measured strictly within one team context is heavily influenced by role, roster construction, redundancy, coaching scheme, usage environment, and numerous other factors independent of a player's true level. Two players can generate similar impact signals on one roster while having very different portability across the league as a whole. So, how a player retains his value on different types of teams, not just the one he happens to be on, is important. The goal is to approximate a player’s average impact across many plausible team environments, not just the one he currently happens to be in.\n\n# How I Approximate That\n\nThe evaluation is a synthesis of several signal layers:\n\n**Impact metrics**  \nRAPM-family signals, possession-value box models, lineup and on/off data. These provide directional and magnitude signal but are always interpreted in context.\n\n**Film and mechanism evaluation**  \nFilm helps determine how impact is being generated and how likely it is to translate across defensive schemes and playoff environments.\n\n**Multi-year signal stabilization**  \nSingle-season spikes are treated cautiously unless supported by mechanism and historical precedent. To avoid drowning in statistical noise, it's important to use evidence from surrounding seasons to inform this season's valuation.\n\n**Contextual Factors**  \nSome skill packages historically maintain impact more consistently across team constructions, matchups, and playoff environments. Three big questions here: (1) how well does a player retain his value when paired with other high level teammates, and how well does he allow them to retain their value? (2) how well does a player's portfolio of skills translate to the style of play we see in playoff environments? (3) what other contextual factors (role, team construction, coaching, redundancies or lack thereof) might be inflating or suppressing the metrics beyond what we'd see from the player on a random team?\n\n**Historical calibration**  \nMy 600-season database is used to anchor magnitude. New seasons are placed relative to known historical impact clusters.\n\n# Midseason Context\n\nThese are midseason point estimates. I will calculate the final season version after the playoffs wrap up, and this will include explicit uncertainty ranges.\n\nAt this point in the season, tier placement and broad ordering tend to stabilize earlier than exact magnitude. Midseason estimates are anchored to prior full-season calibrated levels and adjusted based on current-season evidence so far.\n\n# Interpretive Scale for Net Valuations\n\n7.0+ → GOAT-level peak (≈ top 2–3 peaks ever)  \n6.0+ → All-time great peak (≈ top \\~10 peaks ever)  \n5.4–6.0 → Strong MVP level  \n4.6–5.4 → Solid MVP level  \n4.0–4.6 → Weak MVP level  \n3.0+ → Solid All-NBA level  \n1.5+ → All-Star level\n\nImpact estimates are (roughly) measured in points per game of impact contribution to a random team, adjusted to calibrate the proxy to added championship probability.\n\n# 2025–26 Midseason Snapshot\n\n\\~14 players considered for this exercise as candidates for the top 10 spots; assumes full health\n\n* format: Player X (point estimates for impact: OFF, DEF, NET)\n\n# Locks\n\nNikola Jokic — (6.2, 0.2, 6.4)  \nShai Gilgeous-Alexander — (5.0, 0.6, 5.6)  \nGiannis Antetokounmpo — (3.5, 1.4, 4.9)  \nVictor Wembanyama — (1.7, 3.0, 4.7)  \nStephen Curry — (4.4, -0.2, 4.2)\n\n# Near Locks / Very Strong Candidates\n\nLuka Doncic — (4.0, -0.3, 3.7)  \nKawhi Leonard — (3.1, 0.5, 3.6)  \nCade Cunningham — (2.9, 0.7, 3.6)\n\n# Remaining Candidates\n\n(Heavy confidence interval overlap, difficult to cleanly rank)\n\nTyrese Maxey — (3.3, 0.0, 3.3)  \nJalen Brunson — (3.6, -0.4, 3.2)  \nJamal Murray — (3.4, -0.3, 3.1)  \nAnthony Edwards — (2.7, 0.4, 3.1)  \nJaylen Brown — (2.8, 0.3, 3.1)  \nDonovan Mitchell — (3.3, -0.3, 3.0)\n\n— Top-10 candidate line —\n\nIf forced to add one more today:  \nChet Holmgren — (0.5, 2.3, 2.8)\n\nHappy to answer questions about methodology or discuss specific players.

It devalues your draft picks and risks injury of your stars. Isolating a single game, it is pretty significantly a bad value proposition to try to win. That is, unless you go deep in the playoffs or even win a championship. This is the thesis statement for tanking. And honestly, no clever trick or interesting rule has changed or will change that. If winning becomes a positive value, then you obviously have a positive feedback loop where good teams get value and losing teams lose value. As a result, any plan to fix tanking by making tanking less favorable will automatically make the balancing function between good and bad teams weaker, which is an essential aspect of the parity in the sport.\n\nSo for any solution, it seems like there are two major ways to truly end tanking: take wins and losses out of the equation or give the worst teams some assets that are more valuable on truly bad teams than they are on teams that are pretending to be bad. An extreme example of the former is literally why having a committee that decides who are truly the worst teams, factoring in sketchy tactics, strength of schedule, basically the reverse college sports ranking system and have that decide the lottery. The latter is a bit difficult to pin down. Ultimately, everybody needs talent. Good teams need talent. Bad teams need talent. Trade or salary exemptions are pretty important for everybody. Maybe something that can give teams more dart throws of talent? Like some eased restrictions or exceptions on trades that return more players than it sends for the teams at the bottom of the standings? This is definitely something that would need more thoughts.\n\nI'm not really positing a specific rule change to eliminate tanking, but I feel like I see a lot of threads that fall into the two obvious traps of neither actually flipping the script on wins having a significant negative value to non-contenders nor avoiding a situation where the worst teams stay losing.\n\nLet me know what you all think!", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qzujwb", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Round-Walrus3175", "score": 70, "comments": 45, "created_utc": 1770611234.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770708025, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "5e6718418b67765c54954b017cc2133de7e9b642", "source": "reddit", "title": "I don’t get the hate for “tanking” and ultimately it gives the NBA more parity than any other sports league (of the big 4 in America.)", "body": "I see a lot of people trying to come up with solutions to prevent tanking (purposely throwing games to get a higher overall pick.) \n\nIn the moment it sort of sucks if you follow a team day in and day out knowing they’re going to lose. But it’s the same thing if they genuinely suck. But it’s better for the NBA to have a team that’s mediocre tank to become competitive than a team that’s outright terrible year after year. \n\nCompare it to other sports. In the NFL there’s no lottery. The worst team gets the first pick. Yet, the same few teams dominate every year. Since 2011 every AFC championship game has had either the Patriots or Chiefs in it. I think coaching and general management/ownership impacts winning more than talent in the NFL. The best player in NFL history was a 6th overall pick. \n\nMatthew Stafford was a first overall pick and didn’t win squat with the Lions. Traded to the Rams and within a few seasons has a Super Bowl ring and MVP. All because he’s coached by an elite offensive coach. If you have bad ownership and bad coaching  you can have all the talent imaginable and you won’t win anything. The Jets, Browns, Raiders, etc.  \n\nNow look at the MLB. The Dodgers are well on their way to winning a third consecutive championship. And they’d have even more if they didn’t get screwed by cheaters in the WS back to back years in 2017 and 2018. Basically the rest of the teams are competing to be either the 2nd best NL team or for an American League pennant. The only team in recent memory that succeeded in tanking is the Astros and they cheated for one of their two championships. Teams that suck in baseball suck because their owners are penny pinchers. Even if they get elite draft picks they’ll just be traded or signed to a mega deal by a World Series contender once their contract is over. Paul Skenes is a good example. \n\nSure there’s “dynasties” in the NBA but nothing compared to the NFL, for example. The Warriors are the latest example. But Steph Curry only has 4 rings and has been playing since 2009. Mahomes already has 3 super bowls and started playing in 2018. \n\nPeople complain about tanking but will wear the jersey of the super star they wound up getting in the draft and when they win the championship they’ll forget their team even did it. People were up in arms over the Luka trade last year and the Mavs wound up getting Cooper Flagg because of it. And Luka hasn’t done anything with the Lakers. \n\n“It’s not fair to the fans that pay for tickets to see stars get pulled.”\n\nNot a real argument in a league that has random rest days and load management even for the elite teams. And if the team they paid to see sucks they only spent less than $50 for good seats on a ticket anyways. Total crapshoot on who you’re going to see play on any given day. \n\nWhy would owners risk whatever star players they have getting injured in ultimately meaningless games? Even if they don’t win because of the top overall pick, the revenue and ticket sales they get the following season are well worth it.\n\nAnd if you genuinely think tanking sucks, what’s the fix? You already have a lottery system. You want a play in tournament for the first few picks? Good luck getting owners and players to agree to play in even more games when they had to make rules to give the MVP to a player that plays most of the season. \n\nEvery suggestion I’ve seen has been terrible. A bunch of them are asinine like why don’t we take all the eligible players in the draft and put their names in a hat and have a team representative pick blindfolded and that’s the player they get.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qz8tjr", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "wetcornbread", "score": 0, "comments": 47, "created_utc": 1770557052.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770708025, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "583988c8aa9da80753aeca1a2e8bf5cda1a98732", "source": "reddit", "title": "Why has NBA fandom become more about rings than enjoying regular-season basketball?", "body": "I’ve been thinking about this for a while, and I’m genuinely confused about why NBA fandom has become so ring-obsessed that it almost ignores the product most fans actually consume.\n\nMost fans are not front-office analysts. We’re not running championship probability models or thinking in terms of “windows.” We’re people who live in a city, buy tickets, and plan weekends around games. For us, the regular season isn’t filler, it is the product.\n\nTake the recent Cleveland Cavaliers teams. They’ve had strong regular-season records, a clear identity, young talent, and they play competitive basketball most nights. The arena is engaged, the team feels alive, and fans have something to look forward to week after week. From a fan-experience standpoint, that feels like success.\n\nOr take the Giannis-led Milwaukee Bucks over multiple seasons. Even outside the championship year, those teams consistently won a lot of regular-season games, had stars playing most nights, and gave local fans a high-quality product across the year. Yet even with that, seasons that ended short of a deep playoff run were quickly reframed as disappointments or failures.\n\nThat disconnect is what bothers me.\n\nA 50-win team that plays hard, has continuity, and gives fans meaningful games for 6–7 months is now treated as “stuck” or “useless” if it doesn’t make a conference finals or Finals. Front offices respond by dismantling good, watchable teams in the name of chasing a title that only one team wins anyway.\n\nFrom a fan perspective, that logic feels broken.\n\nThe parade lasts one day.\n\nThe season lasts eight months.\n\nWhy should I, as someone who actually attends games and watches weekly, accept a worse regular-season product now for a hypothetical payoff later? Why should I be happy with stars sitting, effort being managed, or teams pivoting toward tanking, all so the franchise can say it “maximized its championship odds”?\n\nWhat makes this worse is how ring culture trains fans to think like executives instead of fans. We stop asking “Was that a good basketball game?” and start asking “Does this translate in the playoffs?” We start defending decisions that make the regular season less enjoyable because media narratives tell us anything short of a title is meaningless.\n\nBut that framing benefits front offices, media debates, and legacy arguments, not the people in the arena on a random Friday night.\n\nEven good teams aren’t allowed to just be good anymore. If you’re not a championship team, you’re expected to either blow it up or radically reshape, which leads to endless cycles of rebuilding, short contention windows, and little continuity. The result is a league where your favorite team is either all-in for a ring or bad at everything else, with very little space for sustained, enjoyable competitiveness.\n\nI’m not saying championships don’t matter. Of course they do. But when the pursuit of rings starts devaluing the majority of games fans actually watch, something feels off.\n\nWhy can’t the default goal be: play hard, be competitive, build continuity, and give fans something to enjoy every other week, and if a championship eventually comes, great? Why does everything have to be judged only at the very end?\n\nGenuinely curious: at what point did NBA fandom stop being about enjoying basketball and start being about auditing legacies?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qyhs5k", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Kitchen_Pomegranate7", "score": 254, "comments": 150, "created_utc": 1770480723.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770708025, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "0a95737e39d6705be5a4411ea9cf34a11b1e0320", "source": "reddit", "title": "Did big men stop being skilled in the 2010s, or were they just as skilled in the previous eras, but made obsolete by stretch bigs", "body": "Many 90s fans call their era the golden age of big men.

The chance at a #1 pick basically incentivizes every team to be as worse as possible. Let's look at the current tankathon.com rankings and the teams that own their own picks and might tank:   \n\n\n1: Sacramento: Obviously they would still tank if there's no lottery.  \n\n3. Indiana: I don't think Indiana wants to tank and I don't think getting rid of the lottery would change anything.    \n\n4. Brooklyn: They would continue to tank in either system.    \n\n5-6: Was, Utah: Both teams need to keep their pick, so they would tank in either system. However, because the lottery potentially drops their ranking, it encourages them to be worse than just 8.    \n\n7-9: Dallas, Memphis, Milwaukee: I think without a lottery system, these teams would not have any chance to break into the top 4. I don't think tanking for positioning between picks 7-11 is worth it. I think they'd compete harder if there was no lottery.   \n\n12-13: Chicago, Charlotte: Being in the lottery gives these teams incentive to stay there. No lottery would limit tanking.     \n\n15. Miami: Again, depending on how things go, they might.  benefit from breaking into the lottery and getting a chance at a top 4 pick. No lottery discourages tanking.    \n\n\nAs you can see, a no lottery system doesn't really affect the most egregious tankers, but it does limit tanking for teams in the 5-15 range. This pretty much mirrors what we see in the NFL. Someone might disagree with which teams would continue to tank in a new hypothetical system, but hopefully we can agree there's logic to eliminating the Lottery.   \n\nWhat do you think?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qxuty6", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "mathis4losers", "score": 0, "comments": 32, "created_utc": 1770414069.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770708026, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "5deb8939f0e1fd83298a9e551180f25c135543fe", "source": "reddit", "title": "Someone smarter than me explain Kyle Filipowski", "body": "With the Jaren Jackson Jr trade it seems like there is no future for Filipowski with the Jazz.

But I see people either say he is an elite scorer and rising, or others say he is an inneficent complete ball stopper. So I wanted to explore a bit of whether Cam Thomas is an elite scorer or not.\n\nDisclaimer: I am a casual NBA fan, and I only watched 7-9 games of Cam Thomas, so this evaluation is extremely surface level.\n\nTo me, Cam Thomas isn't an elite scorer, he's a great shot maker, meaning he can make almost any kind of shot out there and it has a chance of going in The reason why I don't believe he is an elite scorer is that, to me, elite scorers have many different counters and answers to different defensive looks and sort of have a conceptual flow chart when they have the ball in their hand and can use athletic or fundamental advantages to get easier shots. And as a result, they can force the defense to adjust to them. For example, people like Kobe or SGA have several different answers to a multitude of defensive situations and counters within counters for the defense, while keeping things simple and leaning into tougher shots later in the shot clock or in the game when their teams need it.\n\nWhen I look at Cam Thomas, he can hit tough shots and get hot instantly, but his scoring ability is more limited due to his physicals and his height. He can get to his spots like the elbow or the key, but he has to work hard in order to get there and expend more energy than other scorers. And he doesn't have effective counters to what the defense is doing. As a result of this, he isn't great at generating space, and he tries beat the defense with his shotmaking ability, which leads to more difficult shots and less efficiency.  [Example 1](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;GameID=0022500704&amp;PlayerID=1630560&amp;Season=2025-26&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=&amp;flag=3&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game), [Example 2](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;GameID=0022500694&amp;PlayerID=1630560&amp;Season=2025-26&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=&amp;flag=3&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game).\n\nFor example, outside of shooting or driving, when he is open, if he can't drive to the basket, he would either step back for a mid-range get to the key for a floater/pull-up shot, or go all the way to the basket for a layup. He has more options/ reads than im giving him credit for when it comes to scoring, but my point is that his options are either not available or not effective once the inital reads are taken away.\n\nHe also doesn't have great size, elite handles, great shooting, or rim gravity, so he has to work extra hard just to create shots himself. He isn't much of a threat to defenses and they can defend these options without worrying about effective counters so as a result he can get easy buckets vs bad defenders or small defenders and can score well early in a season but once teams scout him or get closer to the playoffs the difficulty of his shots go up exponentially where his shot difficulty can be a 5 or 6/10 to a 8 or 9/10 which he can hit but not at enough of a rate for the shot to be effiecent in the first place. \n\nWhere Cam Thomas is at his best, in my opinion, is in early offense or transition and off the ball. Where he can start off with an advantage, where he can simplify his game, get to his spots easier, and reduce the difficulty of his shots, although his ceiling on these looks is not high especially this season, the efficiency for these looks has been lower than in 2023-24 and 24-25 [Cam Thomas | Guard | Brooklyn Nets | NBA.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1630560/shots-dash). He can use these situations to build a better foundation for scoring and increase his efficiency.\n\nI don’t believe that Cam Thomas is a ball hog. In my opinion, he's a willing passer, but he isn't consistently good at more complex reads. For example, if he is in the pick and roll or getting doubled, he will have issues locating the open man. Also, since he's on a bad team, he needs to get something going for the offense, and that means his shot selection can be wild at times to generate offense to make up for the lack of creation Brooklyn already has.\n\nAs a result, I don't think he is an elite scorer, he just doesn't have the tools that guys like Kyrie, SGA, Kobe, or Allen Iverson have to keep the defense on its heels. To me hes a microwave scorer and an elite shotmaker. He is sort of like a quarterback who thrives off one read, but when that read is taken away or limited, his efficiency goes down.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qx2c0f", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Comer_Agua", "score": 68, "comments": 100, "created_utc": 1770336769.0, "mode": "hot", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770708026, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "48b16bfa8843716f8a32e2c06da5ef5b5a44dde8", "source": "reddit", "title": "He is coming to the BULLS!", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0tlty", "subreddit": "chicagobulls", "author": "Cultural_Ad9114", "score": 0, "comments": 4, "created_utc": 1770705686.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770708027, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "68e6a1f5f5f6e07f022933e571fb2c5495b3f550", "source": "reddit", "title": "\"Hey Sexton stop ball hogging\" | Sexton: 😤", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0sr0s", "subreddit": "chicagobulls", "author": "sukari", "score": 20, "comments": 0, "created_utc": 1770702829.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770708027, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "370ada885a00c9f4433aac69c369b020a73215f8", "source": "reddit", "title": "Ayo Dosunmu Drops 21 Points In His First Wolves Victory Against The Atlanta Hawks | 02.09.26", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0roa3", "subreddit": "chicagobulls", "author": "ChiBaller", "score": 200, "comments": 71, "created_utc": 1770699456.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770708027, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "73c7955f52f8ae563ab85ce77356351a66238649", "source": "reddit", "title": "Post Game Thread - NBA: The Nets defeat the Bulls on Feb 9, 2026, the final score is 123-115.", "body": "This post contains content not supported on old Reddit.

Examine their % in 15-19 ft.\n\n\\*note, these stats are playoff stats only to reflect effectiveness against the most meaningful competition\n\n|.|LBJ|'17| age|32-|33|MJ|'97| age|33-|34|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|.|**fgm**|**fga**|**eFG**|**%as**|**%ua**|**fgm**|**fga**|**eFG**|**%as**|**%ua**|\n|0-4|133|180|73.9|42.9|57.1|65|108|60.2|41.5|58.5|\n|5-9|16|35|45.7|12.5|87.5|18|35|51.4|38.9|61.1|\n|10-14|6|22|27.3|0|100|61|131|46.6|41|59|\n|15-19|13|30|43.3|23.1|76.9|68|154|44.2|48.5|51.5|\n|20-24|22|45|67.8|27.3|72.7|15|67|32.1|66.7|33.3|\n|25-29|26|71|54.9|42.3|57.7|0|2|0|0|0|\n|3pt |43|106|40.6%|||13|66|19.7%|||\n\n|.|**LBJ**|'18| **age**|**33-**|**34**|**MJ**|'98| **age**|**34-**|**35**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|.|**fgm**|**fga**|**eFG**|**%as**|**%ua**|**fgm**|**fga**|**eFG**|**%as**|**%ua**|\n|0-4|158|216|73.1|24.7|75.3|88|133|66.2|46.6|53.4|\n|5-9 ft.|15|41|36.6|6.7|93.3|20|44|45.5|25|75|\n|10-14|22|47|46.8|4.5|95.5|45|109|41.3|51.1|48.9|\n|15-19|29|68|42.6|6.9|93.1|63|161|39.1|46|54|\n|20-24|19|51|44.1|31.6|68.4|24|62|46.8|70.8|29.2|\n|25-29|31|84|55.4|29|71|3|15|30|100|0|\n|3pt |38|111|34.2%|||13|41|31.7%|||\n\nfocusing strictly on jumpshots and layups.

These were the two seasons MJ and Lebron were probably at their best in terms of shooting, and the point in their ages and careers where they were less reliant on their athleticism and therefore needed to compensate with more shooting. Since Lebron did not make the playoffs due to injury in 18-19, and Jordan's stats in 95-96 are unavailable, I couldnt exactly line up the ages.\n\nWhile there are some data collected by fans on Jordan between 90-92, it is incomplete and arguably cherry picked, as one commenter in the following reddit post argues\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/16lg95i/according\\_to\\_tracking\\_stats\\_michael\\_jordan\\_was/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/16lg95i/according_to_tracking_stats_michael_jordan_was/)\n\nI would tend to agree that it is cherry picked. Not necessarily only because the fans at RealGM intentionally chose the best of Jordan's games, but also possibly because only his best games are the ones fans collect, and therefore there is a survivorship bias on collected footage.\n\nObviously, based on the question of this post, this is a type of question that is opinion based, and unfalsifiable. But to me it is interesting, and it is a fair question to ask which is more effective as a playstyle archetype.\n\nMy primary focus on this post is on playstyles, not to karma farm and spark a GOAT debate in violation of r/nbadiscussion rules.\n\n**My belief** is that Lebron's shot selection is not an indictment on his shooting ability (esp. as it related to Jordan), but rather a deliberate analytics driven choice to maximize high% shots and therefore if he played in the 90s, and played more \"like Mike\", Lebron's resulting midrange fg% would not have changed dramatically, especially given he would have needed to practice it more to adapt to 90s basketball. \n\nFurther I would argue that if MJ played in the modern era, his shot selection would also have become similar to Lebron's with more attempts at the rim, and less midrange and more 3s. It could be argued, that MJ's midrange % would suffer but his 3pt% would improve as both skills do not seem to be entirely transferable, that is, practicing the middy doesn't necessarily make you a better 3pt shooter and vice versa.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0sku7", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Single-Purpose-7608", "score": 38, "comments": 43, "created_utc": 1770702261.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770790024, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "e3950cee2ea841770cd0bda4c3e67ae1c59d18c0", "source": "reddit", "title": "2025-26 Midseason Player Evaluations: Who are the best players in the NBA?", "body": "Over the last decade I’ve worked in data analytics environments and applied inferential statistical methods both inside and outside basketball contexts. Alongside that, I’ve built and maintained a historical database of graded high-impact NBA player seasons that I use for cross-era evaluation.\n\nAt this point, I’ve graded roughly the top 10–15 players from each of the last \\~40 NBA seasons (≈600 player-seasons total). The goal wasn’t just to build ranking lists, but rather to build a stable impact magnitude scale across eras. I periodically revisit those seasons as my framework improves to keep the scale internally consistent. When I evaluate current players, I’m placing them relative to that historical anchor map rather than evaluating them in isolation.\n\nMethodologically, this sits somewhere between pure modeling and pure scouting. I’m not running a single formula and publishing whatever number comes out. Instead, I use a triangulation process across multiple evidence streams and then map that combined signal onto historically calibrated impact tiers.\n\n# The Core Question\n\nThe central question I’m trying to approximate is:\n\n**What is this player’s intrinsic basketball impact level?**\n\nMore concretely:\n\n**If you added this player to a random NBA team, how much would he increase that team’s probability of winning a championship?**\n\nThis matters because value measured strictly within one team context is heavily influenced by role, roster construction, redundancy, coaching scheme, usage environment, and numerous other factors independent of a player's true level. Two players can generate similar impact signals on one roster while having very different portability across the league as a whole. So, how a player retains his value on different types of teams, not just the one he happens to be on, is important. The goal is to approximate a player’s average impact across many plausible team environments, not just the one he currently happens to be in.\n\n# How I Approximate That\n\nThe evaluation is a synthesis of several signal layers:\n\n**Impact metrics**  \nRAPM-family signals, possession-value box models, lineup and on/off data. These provide directional and magnitude signal but are always interpreted in context.\n\n**Film and mechanism evaluation**  \nFilm helps determine how impact is being generated and how likely it is to translate across defensive schemes and playoff environments.\n\n**Multi-year signal stabilization**  \nSingle-season spikes are treated cautiously unless supported by mechanism and historical precedent. To avoid drowning in statistical noise, it's important to use evidence from surrounding seasons to inform this season's valuation.\n\n**Contextual Factors**  \nSome skill packages historically maintain impact more consistently across team constructions, matchups, and playoff environments. Three big questions here: (1) how well does a player retain his value when paired with other high level teammates, and how well does he allow them to retain their value? (2) how well does a player's portfolio of skills translate to the style of play we see in playoff environments? (3) what other contextual factors (role, team construction, coaching, redundancies or lack thereof) might be inflating or suppressing the metrics beyond what we'd see from the player on a random team?\n\n**Historical calibration**  \nMy 600-season database is used to anchor magnitude. New seasons are placed relative to known historical impact clusters.\n\n# Midseason Context\n\nThese are midseason point estimates. I will calculate the final season version after the playoffs wrap up, and this will include explicit uncertainty ranges.\n\nAt this point in the season, tier placement and broad ordering tend to stabilize earlier than exact magnitude. Midseason estimates are anchored to prior full-season calibrated levels and adjusted based on current-season evidence so far.\n\n# Interpretive Scale for Net Valuations\n\n7.0+ → GOAT-level peak (≈ top 2–3 peaks ever)  \n6.0+ → All-time great peak (≈ top \\~10 peaks ever)  \n5.4–6.0 → Strong MVP level  \n4.6–5.4 → Solid MVP level  \n4.0–4.6 → Weak MVP level  \n3.0+ → Solid All-NBA level  \n1.5+ → All-Star level\n\nImpact estimates are (roughly) measured in points per game of impact contribution to a random team, adjusted to calibrate the proxy to added championship probability.\n\n# 2025–26 Midseason Snapshot\n\n\\~14 players considered for this exercise as candidates for the top 10 spots; assumes full health\n\n* format: Player X (point estimates for impact: OFF, DEF, NET)\n\n# Locks\n\nNikola Jokic — (6.2, 0.2, 6.4)  \nShai Gilgeous-Alexander — (5.0, 0.6, 5.6)  \nGiannis Antetokounmpo — (3.5, 1.4, 4.9)  \nVictor Wembanyama — (1.7, 3.0, 4.7)  \nStephen Curry — (4.4, -0.2, 4.2)\n\n# Near Locks / Very Strong Candidates\n\nLuka Doncic — (4.0, -0.3, 3.7)  \nKawhi Leonard — (3.1, 0.5, 3.6)  \nCade Cunningham — (2.9, 0.7, 3.6)\n\n# Remaining Candidates\n\n(Heavy confidence interval overlap, difficult to cleanly rank)\n\nTyrese Maxey — (3.3, 0.0, 3.3)  \nJalen Brunson — (3.6, -0.4, 3.2)  \nJamal Murray — (3.4, -0.3, 3.1)  \nAnthony Edwards — (2.7, 0.4, 3.1)  \nJaylen Brown — (2.8, 0.3, 3.1)  \nDonovan Mitchell — (3.3, -0.3, 3.0)\n\n— Top-10 candidate line —\n\nIf forced to add one more today:  \nChet Holmgren — (0.5, 2.3, 2.8)\n\nHappy to answer questions about methodology or discuss specific players.

It devalues your draft picks and risks injury of your stars. Isolating a single game, it is pretty significantly a bad value proposition to try to win. That is, unless you go deep in the playoffs or even win a championship. This is the thesis statement for tanking. And honestly, no clever trick or interesting rule has changed or will change that. If winning becomes a positive value, then you obviously have a positive feedback loop where good teams get value and losing teams lose value. As a result, any plan to fix tanking by making tanking less favorable will automatically make the balancing function between good and bad teams weaker, which is an essential aspect of the parity in the sport.\n\nSo for any solution, it seems like there are two major ways to truly end tanking: take wins and losses out of the equation or give the worst teams some assets that are more valuable on truly bad teams than they are on teams that are pretending to be bad. An extreme example of the former is literally why having a committee that decides who are truly the worst teams, factoring in sketchy tactics, strength of schedule, basically the reverse college sports ranking system and have that decide the lottery. The latter is a bit difficult to pin down. Ultimately, everybody needs talent. Good teams need talent. Bad teams need talent. Trade or salary exemptions are pretty important for everybody. Maybe something that can give teams more dart throws of talent? Like some eased restrictions or exceptions on trades that return more players than it sends for the teams at the bottom of the standings? This is definitely something that would need more thoughts.\n\nI'm not really positing a specific rule change to eliminate tanking, but I feel like I see a lot of threads that fall into the two obvious traps of neither actually flipping the script on wins having a significant negative value to non-contenders nor avoiding a situation where the worst teams stay losing.\n\nLet me know what you all think!", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qzujwb", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Round-Walrus3175", "score": 75, "comments": 57, "created_utc": 1770611234.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770790025, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "c1fa870f98d9bc1b87d3955b4128bf64fd4b47d7", "source": "reddit", "title": "I don’t get the hate for “tanking” and ultimately it gives the NBA more parity than any other sports league (of the big 4 in America.)", "body": "I see a lot of people trying to come up with solutions to prevent tanking (purposely throwing games to get a higher overall pick.) \n\nIn the moment it sort of sucks if you follow a team day in and day out knowing they’re going to lose. But it’s the same thing if they genuinely suck. But it’s better for the NBA to have a team that’s mediocre tank to become competitive than a team that’s outright terrible year after year. \n\nCompare it to other sports. In the NFL there’s no lottery. The worst team gets the first pick. Yet, the same few teams dominate every year. Since 2011 every AFC championship game has had either the Patriots or Chiefs in it. I think coaching and general management/ownership impacts winning more than talent in the NFL. The best player in NFL history was a 6th overall pick. \n\nMatthew Stafford was a first overall pick and didn’t win squat with the Lions. Traded to the Rams and within a few seasons has a Super Bowl ring and MVP. All because he’s coached by an elite offensive coach. If you have bad ownership and bad coaching  you can have all the talent imaginable and you won’t win anything. The Jets, Browns, Raiders, etc.  \n\nNow look at the MLB. The Dodgers are well on their way to winning a third consecutive championship. And they’d have even more if they didn’t get screwed by cheaters in the WS back to back years in 2017 and 2018. Basically the rest of the teams are competing to be either the 2nd best NL team or for an American League pennant. The only team in recent memory that succeeded in tanking is the Astros and they cheated for one of their two championships. Teams that suck in baseball suck because their owners are penny pinchers. Even if they get elite draft picks they’ll just be traded or signed to a mega deal by a World Series contender once their contract is over. Paul Skenes is a good example. \n\nSure there’s “dynasties” in the NBA but nothing compared to the NFL, for example. The Warriors are the latest example. But Steph Curry only has 4 rings and has been playing since 2009. Mahomes already has 3 super bowls and started playing in 2018. \n\nPeople complain about tanking but will wear the jersey of the super star they wound up getting in the draft and when they win the championship they’ll forget their team even did it. People were up in arms over the Luka trade last year and the Mavs wound up getting Cooper Flagg because of it. And Luka hasn’t done anything with the Lakers. \n\n“It’s not fair to the fans that pay for tickets to see stars get pulled.”\n\nNot a real argument in a league that has random rest days and load management even for the elite teams. And if the team they paid to see sucks they only spent less than $50 for good seats on a ticket anyways. Total crapshoot on who you’re going to see play on any given day. \n\nWhy would owners risk whatever star players they have getting injured in ultimately meaningless games? Even if they don’t win because of the top overall pick, the revenue and ticket sales they get the following season are well worth it.\n\nAnd if you genuinely think tanking sucks, what’s the fix? You already have a lottery system. You want a play in tournament for the first few picks? Good luck getting owners and players to agree to play in even more games when they had to make rules to give the MVP to a player that plays most of the season. \n\nEvery suggestion I’ve seen has been terrible. A bunch of them are asinine like why don’t we take all the eligible players in the draft and put their names in a hat and have a team representative pick blindfolded and that’s the player they get.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qz8tjr", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "wetcornbread", "score": 0, "comments": 49, "created_utc": 1770557052.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770790025, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "44dbf8c78e54ac4140346100810ff584f5730cae", "source": "reddit", "title": "Why has NBA fandom become more about rings than enjoying regular-season basketball?", "body": "I’ve been thinking about this for a while, and I’m genuinely confused about why NBA fandom has become so ring-obsessed that it almost ignores the product most fans actually consume.\n\nMost fans are not front-office analysts. We’re not running championship probability models or thinking in terms of “windows.” We’re people who live in a city, buy tickets, and plan weekends around games. For us, the regular season isn’t filler, it is the product.\n\nTake the recent Cleveland Cavaliers teams. They’ve had strong regular-season records, a clear identity, young talent, and they play competitive basketball most nights. The arena is engaged, the team feels alive, and fans have something to look forward to week after week. From a fan-experience standpoint, that feels like success.\n\nOr take the Giannis-led Milwaukee Bucks over multiple seasons. Even outside the championship year, those teams consistently won a lot of regular-season games, had stars playing most nights, and gave local fans a high-quality product across the year. Yet even with that, seasons that ended short of a deep playoff run were quickly reframed as disappointments or failures.\n\nThat disconnect is what bothers me.\n\nA 50-win team that plays hard, has continuity, and gives fans meaningful games for 6–7 months is now treated as “stuck” or “useless” if it doesn’t make a conference finals or Finals. Front offices respond by dismantling good, watchable teams in the name of chasing a title that only one team wins anyway.\n\nFrom a fan perspective, that logic feels broken.\n\nThe parade lasts one day.\n\nThe season lasts eight months.\n\nWhy should I, as someone who actually attends games and watches weekly, accept a worse regular-season product now for a hypothetical payoff later? Why should I be happy with stars sitting, effort being managed, or teams pivoting toward tanking, all so the franchise can say it “maximized its championship odds”?\n\nWhat makes this worse is how ring culture trains fans to think like executives instead of fans. We stop asking “Was that a good basketball game?” and start asking “Does this translate in the playoffs?” We start defending decisions that make the regular season less enjoyable because media narratives tell us anything short of a title is meaningless.\n\nBut that framing benefits front offices, media debates, and legacy arguments, not the people in the arena on a random Friday night.\n\nEven good teams aren’t allowed to just be good anymore. If you’re not a championship team, you’re expected to either blow it up or radically reshape, which leads to endless cycles of rebuilding, short contention windows, and little continuity. The result is a league where your favorite team is either all-in for a ring or bad at everything else, with very little space for sustained, enjoyable competitiveness.\n\nI’m not saying championships don’t matter. Of course they do. But when the pursuit of rings starts devaluing the majority of games fans actually watch, something feels off.\n\nWhy can’t the default goal be: play hard, be competitive, build continuity, and give fans something to enjoy every other week, and if a championship eventually comes, great? Why does everything have to be judged only at the very end?\n\nGenuinely curious: at what point did NBA fandom stop being about enjoying basketball and start being about auditing legacies?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qyhs5k", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Kitchen_Pomegranate7", "score": 268, "comments": 151, "created_utc": 1770480723.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770790025, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "f28cf3e34919d9f881687268bfaadb2208cf49ba", "source": "reddit", "title": "Did big men stop being skilled in the 2010s, or were they just as skilled in the previous eras, but made obsolete by stretch bigs", "body": "Many 90s fans call their era the golden age of big men.

We will also limit trade proposals and free agent posts based on their quality, relevance, and how frequently reoccurring the topic may be.\n\nWe do not allow these kinds of posts for several reasons, including, but not limited to: they encourage low-effort replies, pit players against each other, skew readers towards an us-vs-them mentality that inevitably leads to brash hyperbole and insults.\n\n**What we want to see in our sub are well-considered analyses, well-supported opinions, and thoughtful replies that are open to listening to and learning from new perspectives.**\n\nWe grew significantly over the course of the last season. Please be familiar with our community[ and its rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/wiki/rules) before posting or commenting.\n\n# FAQ\n\n**We’d also like to address some common complaints we see in modmail:**\n\n* “*Why me and not them?*”\n   * We will not discuss other users with you.\n* “*The other person was way worse*.”\n   * Other people’s poor behavior does not excuse your own.\n* “*My post was removed for not promoting discussion but it had lots of comments*.”\n   * Incorrect: It was removed for not promoting **serious** discussion. It had comments but they were mostly low-quality. Or your post asked a straightforward question that can be answered in one word or sentence, or by Googling it. Try posting in our weekly questions thread instead.\n* *“My post met the requirements and is high quality but was still removed.*”\n   * Use in-depth arguments to support your opinion. Our sub is looking for posts that dig deeper than the minimum, examining the full context of a player or coach or team, how they changed, grew, and adjusted throughout their career, including the quality of their opponents and cultural impact of their celebrity; how they affected and improved their teammates, responded to coaches, what strategies they employed for different situations and challenges. Etc.\n* *“Why do posts/comments have a minimum character requirement? Why do you remove short posts and comments? Why don’t you let upvotes and downvotes decide?”*\n   * Our goal in this sub is to have a space for high-quality discussion. High-quality requires extra effort. Low-effort posts and comments are not only easier to write but to read, so even in a community where all the users are seeking high-quality, low-effort posts and comments will still garner more upvotes and more attention. If we allow low-effort posts and comments to remain, the community will gravitate towards them, pushing high-effort and high-quality posts and comments to the bottom. This encourages people to put in less effort. Removing them allows high-quality posts and comments to have space at the top, encouraging people to put in more effort in their own comments and posts.\n\nThere are still plenty of active NBA subs where users can enjoy making jokes or memes, or that welcome hot takes, and hyperbole (such as r/NBATalk, r/nbacirclejerk, or r/nba). Ours is not one of them.\n\n**We expect thoughtful, patient, and considerate interactions in our community.** Hopefully this is the reason you are here. If you are new, please take some time to read over our rules and observe, and we welcome you to participate and contribute to the quality of our sub too!\n\n**Discord Server:**\n\nWe have an active Discord server for anyone who wants to join! While the server follows most of the basic rules of this sub (eg. keep it civil), it offers a place for more casual, live discussions (featuring daily hoopgrids competition during the season), and we'd love to see more users getting involved over there as well. It includes channels for various topics such as game-threads for the new season, all-time discussions, analysis and draft/college discussions, as well as other sports such as NFL/college football and baseball.\n\nLink:[ https://discord.gg/8mJYhrT5VZ](https://discord.gg/8mJYhrT5VZ) (let u/roundrajaon34 or other mods know if there are any issues with this link)\n\n**Mega-Threads**\n\nWe see a lot of re-hashing of the same topics over and over again. To help prevent our community from being exhausted by new users starting the same debates and making the same arguments over and over, we will offer mega-threads throughout the off-season for the most popular topics. We will add links to these threads under this post over time.

Nobody won': Inside the messy Kuminga-Warriors divorce", "body": "Kuminga was prepared for the conversation. He knew management wanted to ding him for missing a team-requested event and alert him that someone around him was taking too much food from the family room. The gripes between player and organization, as multiple sources said, had become \"petty\" in the fifth year of a relationship many believed should've ended years before.\n\nKerr never had much success reaching Kuminga on a deeper level, typically one of his coaching superpowers. He'd given him handwritten notes, sent long text messages, tried to connect. But Kuminga rarely reciprocated. Kuminga normally responded dispassionately and sporadically.\n\nIn ESPN's several conversations with Kuminga over the past five years, it became increasingly clear that he viewed Kerr as the figure most responsible for holding back his career, long defined not by progression but rather inconsistency, inexplicable DNPs and tension.\n\n\"Go ask the man himself,\" he'd say with an eye roll after a few of those no-minute or low-minute nights.\n\nOrganizational dynamics loomed above, forcing these two into an uncomfortable and drawn-out professional partnership, but Kuminga knew who controlled strategy and rotation.\n\n\"Everybody was right. Everybody was wrong. Everyone's to blame,\" another team source said. \"Nobody won.\"\n\nIN LATE DECEMBER, amid his third lengthy stretch of DNPs this season, Kuminga started to box up belongings in his Bay Area house, sources close to him said, anticipating a trade and essentially attempting to will it into existence.\n\nHe showed up when required and cheered for teammates at games, but he had his skills trainer, Ant Wells, in town to do individual training at different gyms away from the facility, feeling an increasing eye of distaste from Warriors management and coaches when he'd work on drills to improve his on-ball scoring and playmaking in front of them.\n\n\"He hates working out in this place,\" one source said, pointing down toward the practice court.\n\nSource: https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\\_/id/47880753/inside-ugly-5-year-split-jonathan-kuminga-warriors", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r1z5g2", "subreddit": "nba", "author": "OkExchange7229", "score": 26, "comments": 76, "created_utc": 1770820880.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770829318, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "d5ebabec089d00e8f357a149f433e63660125589", "source": "reddit", "title": "[NBA.com] Kia Rookie Ladder: Maxime Raynaud enters Top 5", "body": "Source: [https://www.nba.com/news/kia-rookie-ladder-feb-11-2026](https://www.nba.com/news/kia-rookie-ladder-feb-11-2026)\n\n\n\n1.

Examine their % in 15-19 ft.\n\n\\*note, these stats are playoff stats only to reflect effectiveness against the most meaningful competition\n\n|.|LBJ|'17| age|32-|33|MJ|'97| age|33-|34|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|.|**fgm**|**fga**|**eFG**|**%as**|**%ua**|**fgm**|**fga**|**eFG**|**%as**|**%ua**|\n|0-4|133|180|73.9|42.9|57.1|65|108|60.2|41.5|58.5|\n|5-9|16|35|45.7|12.5|87.5|18|35|51.4|38.9|61.1|\n|10-14|6|22|27.3|0|100|61|131|46.6|41|59|\n|15-19|13|30|43.3|23.1|76.9|68|154|44.2|48.5|51.5|\n|20-24|22|45|67.8|27.3|72.7|15|67|32.1|66.7|33.3|\n|25-29|26|71|54.9|42.3|57.7|0|2|0|0|0|\n|3pt |43|106|40.6%|||13|66|19.7%|||\n\n|.|**LBJ**|'18| **age**|**33-**|**34**|**MJ**|'98| **age**|**34-**|**35**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|.|**fgm**|**fga**|**eFG**|**%as**|**%ua**|**fgm**|**fga**|**eFG**|**%as**|**%ua**|\n|0-4|158|216|73.1|24.7|75.3|88|133|66.2|46.6|53.4|\n|5-9 ft.|15|41|36.6|6.7|93.3|20|44|45.5|25|75|\n|10-14|22|47|46.8|4.5|95.5|45|109|41.3|51.1|48.9|\n|15-19|29|68|42.6|6.9|93.1|63|161|39.1|46|54|\n|20-24|19|51|44.1|31.6|68.4|24|62|46.8|70.8|29.2|\n|25-29|31|84|55.4|29|71|3|15|30|100|0|\n|3pt |38|111|34.2%|||13|41|31.7%|||\n\nfocusing strictly on jumpshots and layups.

These were the two seasons MJ and Lebron were probably at their best in terms of shooting, and the point in their ages and careers where they were less reliant on their athleticism and therefore needed to compensate with more shooting. Since Lebron did not make the playoffs due to injury in 18-19, and Jordan's stats in 95-96 are unavailable, I couldnt exactly line up the ages.\n\nWhile there are some data collected by fans on Jordan between 90-92, it is incomplete and arguably cherry picked, as one commenter in the following reddit post argues\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/16lg95i/according\\_to\\_tracking\\_stats\\_michael\\_jordan\\_was/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/16lg95i/according_to_tracking_stats_michael_jordan_was/)\n\nI would tend to agree that it is cherry picked. Not necessarily only because the fans at RealGM intentionally chose the best of Jordan's games, but also possibly because only his best games are the ones fans collect, and therefore there is a survivorship bias on collected footage.\n\nObviously, based on the question of this post, this is a type of question that is opinion based, and unfalsifiable. But to me it is interesting, and it is a fair question to ask which is more effective as a playstyle archetype.\n\nMy primary focus on this post is on playstyles, not to karma farm and spark a GOAT debate in violation of r/nbadiscussion rules.\n\n**My belief** is that Lebron's shot selection is not an indictment on his shooting ability (esp. as it related to Jordan), but rather a deliberate analytics driven choice to maximize high% shots and therefore if he played in the 90s, and played more \"like Mike\", Lebron's resulting midrange fg% would not have changed dramatically, especially given he would have needed to practice it more to adapt to 90s basketball. \n\nFurther I would argue that if MJ played in the modern era, his shot selection would also have become similar to Lebron's with more attempts at the rim, and less midrange and more 3s. It could be argued, that MJ's midrange % would suffer but his 3pt% would improve as both skills do not seem to be entirely transferable, that is, practicing the middy doesn't necessarily make you a better 3pt shooter and vice versa.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0sku7", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Single-Purpose-7608", "score": 42, "comments": 43, "created_utc": 1770702261.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770829321, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "ab88732ab3abeba221a0228fae102aa388d3cdc2", "source": "reddit", "title": "2025-26 Midseason Player Evaluations: Who are the best players in the NBA?", "body": "Over the last decade I’ve worked in data analytics environments and applied inferential statistical methods both inside and outside basketball contexts. Alongside that, I’ve built and maintained a historical database of graded high-impact NBA player seasons that I use for cross-era evaluation.\n\nAt this point, I’ve graded roughly the top 10–15 players from each of the last \\~40 NBA seasons (≈600 player-seasons total). The goal wasn’t just to build ranking lists, but rather to build a stable impact magnitude scale across eras. I periodically revisit those seasons as my framework improves to keep the scale internally consistent. When I evaluate current players, I’m placing them relative to that historical anchor map rather than evaluating them in isolation.\n\nMethodologically, this sits somewhere between pure modeling and pure scouting. I’m not running a single formula and publishing whatever number comes out. Instead, I use a triangulation process across multiple evidence streams and then map that combined signal onto historically calibrated impact tiers.\n\n# The Core Question\n\nThe central question I’m trying to approximate is:\n\n**What is this player’s intrinsic basketball impact level?**\n\nMore concretely:\n\n**If you added this player to a random NBA team, how much would he increase that team’s probability of winning a championship?**\n\nThis matters because value measured strictly within one team context is heavily influenced by role, roster construction, redundancy, coaching scheme, usage environment, and numerous other factors independent of a player's true level. Two players can generate similar impact signals on one roster while having very different portability across the league as a whole. So, how a player retains his value on different types of teams, not just the one he happens to be on, is important. The goal is to approximate a player’s average impact across many plausible team environments, not just the one he currently happens to be in.\n\n# How I Approximate That\n\nThe evaluation is a synthesis of several signal layers:\n\n**Impact metrics**  \nRAPM-family signals, possession-value box models, lineup and on/off data. These provide directional and magnitude signal but are always interpreted in context.\n\n**Film and mechanism evaluation**  \nFilm helps determine how impact is being generated and how likely it is to translate across defensive schemes and playoff environments.\n\n**Multi-year signal stabilization**  \nSingle-season spikes are treated cautiously unless supported by mechanism and historical precedent. To avoid drowning in statistical noise, it's important to use evidence from surrounding seasons to inform this season's valuation.\n\n**Contextual Factors**  \nSome skill packages historically maintain impact more consistently across team constructions, matchups, and playoff environments. Three big questions here: (1) how well does a player retain his value when paired with other high level teammates, and how well does he allow them to retain their value? (2) how well does a player's portfolio of skills translate to the style of play we see in playoff environments? (3) what other contextual factors (role, team construction, coaching, redundancies or lack thereof) might be inflating or suppressing the metrics beyond what we'd see from the player on a random team?\n\n**Historical calibration**  \nMy 600-season database is used to anchor magnitude. New seasons are placed relative to known historical impact clusters.\n\n# Midseason Context\n\nThese are midseason point estimates. I will calculate the final season version after the playoffs wrap up, and this will include explicit uncertainty ranges.\n\nAt this point in the season, tier placement and broad ordering tend to stabilize earlier than exact magnitude. Midseason estimates are anchored to prior full-season calibrated levels and adjusted based on current-season evidence so far.\n\n# Interpretive Scale for Net Valuations\n\n7.0+ → GOAT-level peak (≈ top 2–3 peaks ever)  \n6.0+ → All-time great peak (≈ top \\~10 peaks ever)  \n5.4–6.0 → Strong MVP level  \n4.6–5.4 → Solid MVP level  \n4.0–4.6 → Weak MVP level  \n3.0+ → Solid All-NBA level  \n1.5+ → All-Star level\n\nImpact estimates are (roughly) measured in points per game of impact contribution to a random team, adjusted to calibrate the proxy to added championship probability.\n\n# 2025–26 Midseason Snapshot\n\n\\~14 players considered for this exercise as candidates for the top 10 spots; assumes full health\n\n* format: Player X (point estimates for impact: OFF, DEF, NET)\n\n# Locks\n\nNikola Jokic — (6.2, 0.2, 6.4)  \nShai Gilgeous-Alexander — (5.0, 0.6, 5.6)  \nGiannis Antetokounmpo — (3.5, 1.4, 4.9)  \nVictor Wembanyama — (1.7, 3.0, 4.7)  \nStephen Curry — (4.4, -0.2, 4.2)\n\n# Near Locks / Very Strong Candidates\n\nLuka Doncic — (4.0, -0.3, 3.7)  \nKawhi Leonard — (3.1, 0.5, 3.6)  \nCade Cunningham — (2.9, 0.7, 3.6)\n\n# Remaining Candidates\n\n(Heavy confidence interval overlap, difficult to cleanly rank)\n\nTyrese Maxey — (3.3, 0.0, 3.3)  \nJalen Brunson — (3.6, -0.4, 3.2)  \nJamal Murray — (3.4, -0.3, 3.1)  \nAnthony Edwards — (2.7, 0.4, 3.1)  \nJaylen Brown — (2.8, 0.3, 3.1)  \nDonovan Mitchell — (3.3, -0.3, 3.0)\n\n— Top-10 candidate line —\n\nIf forced to add one more today:  \nChet Holmgren — (0.5, 2.3, 2.8)\n\nHappy to answer questions about methodology or discuss specific players.

So let’s talk now about what McCain has done this season and what OKC might be getting.\n\n**Danny:**\n\nI have been fascinated with McCain because I thought he was the best rookie last year before he went down. It was a small sample. He played fewer than 600 minutes last year for the Sixers and then came back this year.\n\nHe’s actually now with the little bit of time at the end with Sixers and OKC. He’s now played more minutes this year than he did last year, fewer per game. But that’s partially due to change in role.\n\nAnd so at first, the numbers for McCain were truly terrible on both ends of both parts of offense, the threes and the twos. But his three pointer has gotten back to where it was, which is very encouraging for McCain and for the Thunder. So last year was 38.3 percent on eight per 36.\n\nNow he’s 38 percent on seven per 36. So we’re getting into the same ballpark there. I believe that his three pointer was going to improve back.\n\nBut that wasn’t the thing in the film that really spooked me. Instead, it was the inside the arc game. And those numbers on that are still pretty putrid.\n\nSo last year, Jared McCain converted 53 percent of his twos and was taking them at a reasonable volume. This year, that’s down to 39 percent. And there are a lot of different troubling things there.\n\nEven with the stats, some of this you expect to improve. So his simple strike quality is actually better this year than last year, but his shot making is way down. His contested finishing is at 43 percent, which is horrendous, doing really poorly on the self-created stuff.\n\nAnd so that made me really want to dig into the film. And like I said, I thought that the three-pointer looked totally fine both last year and this year. I wasn’t worried in the early part of the season when McCain was shooting 32 percent.\n\nIt just didn’t seem like that was anything real. But the half court film for this year is terrible. And I’m hoping and expecting that this is injury related.\n\nSo there were a couple of plays where he either couldn’t beat his guys, and I mean, Hugo Gonzalez is not a bad defender, we just talked about in the length. But there was a play where McCain couldn’t beat him on a drive, settled for a bad mid ranger and missed. But then the plays that were more concerning were the ones where he had some sort of an advantage, but then it still didn’t produce anything.\n\nThere was one where, against the Mavs, where Ryan Nemhard got screened and was still able to recover from the screen to get back to Jared McCain. McCain tried to do the WNBA step through, which did get him a better look. But that sort of play was like a guy gets screened and can still recover to you.\n\nAnd I just didn’t see any pop for him in the half court or really in transition. And now, part of it for McCain is that he looks Maxey and VJ Edgecombe are just such talented athletes that you’re the other guy that looks like you’re slow motion there. But he also wasn’t that great an athlete to begin with.\n\nAnd another one of those limited defensive plays was that there was one against the Knicks, where Tyler Kolek came out to pressure right around half court. And Jared McCain just traveled. And like Jared McCain last year, he did all that.\n\nPart of the reason I was so encouraged with him was because he had a 25% usage rate. Like he was doing a lot with the ball in his hands. He’s just been out of sorts.\n\nBut the good news, and I see it as mostly good news for The Thunder, is that when you consider that this is his age 21 season, the things that look off on Jared McCain, and they look so off that I actually went back and watched some of his 2024-25 film to just see if he was a different player. And my answer was yes. I think that he did look more aggressive.\n\nNow, he’s never been a great athlete. But getting, some people talk a lot about how, and this is true to an extent, oh, it’s so bad when a hyper-athletic guy loses a step. And that’s true.\n\nBut it’s in some ways even more damaging when a less athletic guy loses a half step or a full step, because then they just don’t have any advantages anymore. And so I think that based on the injuries he’s had, my inclination is that this is a temporary thing. And I mean, it was encouraging that in the Thunder game against the Rockets, McCain plus 12 in the 14 minutes he played, that was a, the Thunder had some weird on-off was in that one.\n\nGot it, made a three, was one for three from two. But the crux of it is like basically can McCain, we know the three-pointers already bounced back, but even with that bouncing back, because he’s not getting to the line anymore, lower usage, and he’s not 39% on twos, is that real? And so I think that he can get back to where he was.\n\nBut the film is truly awful.\n\n**Nate:**\n\nYeah, I thought he looked heavy when he came back, but there wasn’t a great excuse for that, because remember, he had the thumb issue as well, and he had been out really since November of last year. Now he had the meniscus repair, and that definitely can bother guys to be sure, but ultimately, it shouldn’t be as bad as something like an ACL necessarily. So I am concerned.\n\nI also just don’t quite see how he fits in. And Daryl Morey said basically, he was pretty forthright, I would say, when he said, I am confident that we sold high on him. We got a package back that was commensurate with a high level of starter.\n\n**Danny:**\n\nBy the way, I love the thing that the pick that Daryl Morey got back was a pick that Daryl Morey traded, because it was a pick that the Rockets sent away years ago.\n\n**Nate:**\n\nIn the Westbrook deal. That is pretty good. But I think Morey is probably going to be right.\n\nAnd I know there is some angst in Sixers. Dan linked to the Liberty Ballers piece about how the Sixers just got out of the tax. And Daryl was saying they were going to try to move that pick that they got for something else and just nothing materialized.\n\nAnd they did allow themselves to give Dom Barlow more than the minimum going forward, which they needed to do. Getting him under contract for the future I think is important. And I don’t know that there was a move out there that would have made a ton of sense for the Sixers.\n\nThough it’s worth noting too that they were not first apron hard capped either. Now they would have been hard capped to the first apron if they took on money. So I don’t know that there was some great move there.\n\nIt is, of course, noteworthy that they always seem to get out of the tax. Darryl always seems to get his teams out of the tax. Not that he’s working for owners who probably at least he knows that they would appreciate that.\n\nSo I think these assets will be useful for Philly going forward because there was this first and then they got what, two seconds as well that were decent seconds.\n\n**Danny:**\n\nThey got, basically it’ll be the more favorable of Indiana, Miami, OKC and Houston for 27. So I mean, they could all be competitive, but I expect at least one of those teams won’t be. And then they have Milwaukee in 28, depending on what happens with Giannis Antetokounmpo could be pretty good.\n\n**Nate:**\n\nYeah, if he stays there, that pick could be pretty decent for. Yeah, I think so. I like could he I just can’t really imagine Jared McCain being a starter.\n\n**Danny:**\n\nHe’s a good enough shooter that I think on a real team, right?\n\n**Nate:**\n\nOn a on a OKC level of team.\n\n**Danny:**\n\nYeah, well, maybe not an OKC level team, but on a team that could win a playoff series. It’s you would need a lot of other players to do a lot of good things around him. And that’s always been the case.\n\nI mean, I was I was I think higher on him than some going into that draft. That was the draft for a scout of a billion guys. But it was still always that idea of like he could be a good version of this player, but a great version is going to need him to be a superlative shooter.\n\nAnd I think he’s a very good one. And so how do you harness that? We’ve seen a lot of these like better shooters than they are athlete guys get to a certain level, but then not break through.\n\nBut then guys who are way better athletes like his now former teammates. Like those guys can push.

It devalues your draft picks and risks injury of your stars. Isolating a single game, it is pretty significantly a bad value proposition to try to win. That is, unless you go deep in the playoffs or even win a championship. This is the thesis statement for tanking. And honestly, no clever trick or interesting rule has changed or will change that. If winning becomes a positive value, then you obviously have a positive feedback loop where good teams get value and losing teams lose value. As a result, any plan to fix tanking by making tanking less favorable will automatically make the balancing function between good and bad teams weaker, which is an essential aspect of the parity in the sport.\n\nSo for any solution, it seems like there are two major ways to truly end tanking: take wins and losses out of the equation or give the worst teams some assets that are more valuable on truly bad teams than they are on teams that are pretending to be bad. An extreme example of the former is literally why having a committee that decides who are truly the worst teams, factoring in sketchy tactics, strength of schedule, basically the reverse college sports ranking system and have that decide the lottery. The latter is a bit difficult to pin down. Ultimately, everybody needs talent. Good teams need talent. Bad teams need talent. Trade or salary exemptions are pretty important for everybody. Maybe something that can give teams more dart throws of talent? Like some eased restrictions or exceptions on trades that return more players than it sends for the teams at the bottom of the standings? This is definitely something that would need more thoughts.\n\nI'm not really positing a specific rule change to eliminate tanking, but I feel like I see a lot of threads that fall into the two obvious traps of neither actually flipping the script on wins having a significant negative value to non-contenders nor avoiding a situation where the worst teams stay losing.\n\nLet me know what you all think!", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qzujwb", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Round-Walrus3175", "score": 78, "comments": 59, "created_utc": 1770611234.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770829322, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "2bb6369395a77ce6dcca9551cbdda7bf465a24a8", "source": "reddit", "title": "I don’t get the hate for “tanking” and ultimately it gives the NBA more parity than any other sports league (of the big 4 in America.)", "body": "I see a lot of people trying to come up with solutions to prevent tanking (purposely throwing games to get a higher overall pick.) \n\nIn the moment it sort of sucks if you follow a team day in and day out knowing they’re going to lose.

But it’s better for the NBA to have a team that’s mediocre tank to become competitive than a team that’s outright terrible year after year. \n\nCompare it to other sports. In the NFL there’s no lottery. The worst team gets the first pick. Yet, the same few teams dominate every year. Since 2011 every AFC championship game has had either the Patriots or Chiefs in it. I think coaching and general management/ownership impacts winning more than talent in the NFL. The best player in NFL history was a 6th overall pick. \n\nMatthew Stafford was a first overall pick and didn’t win squat with the Lions. Traded to the Rams and within a few seasons has a Super Bowl ring and MVP. All because he’s coached by an elite offensive coach. If you have bad ownership and bad coaching  you can have all the talent imaginable and you won’t win anything. The Jets, Browns, Raiders, etc.  \n\nNow look at the MLB. The Dodgers are well on their way to winning a third consecutive championship. And they’d have even more if they didn’t get screwed by cheaters in the WS back to back years in 2017 and 2018. Basically the rest of the teams are competing to be either the 2nd best NL team or for an American League pennant. The only team in recent memory that succeeded in tanking is the Astros and they cheated for one of their two championships. Teams that suck in baseball suck because their owners are penny pinchers. Even if they get elite draft picks they’ll just be traded or signed to a mega deal by a World Series contender once their contract is over. Paul Skenes is a good example. \n\nSure there’s “dynasties” in the NBA but nothing compared to the NFL, for example. The Warriors are the latest example. But Steph Curry only has 4 rings and has been playing since 2009. Mahomes already has 3 super bowls and started playing in 2018. \n\nPeople complain about tanking but will wear the jersey of the super star they wound up getting in the draft and when they win the championship they’ll forget their team even did it. People were up in arms over the Luka trade last year and the Mavs wound up getting Cooper Flagg because of it. And Luka hasn’t done anything with the Lakers. \n\n“It’s not fair to the fans that pay for tickets to see stars get pulled.”\n\nNot a real argument in a league that has random rest days and load management even for the elite teams. And if the team they paid to see sucks they only spent less than $50 for good seats on a ticket anyways. Total crapshoot on who you’re going to see play on any given day. \n\nWhy would owners risk whatever star players they have getting injured in ultimately meaningless games? Even if they don’t win because of the top overall pick, the revenue and ticket sales they get the following season are well worth it.\n\nAnd if you genuinely think tanking sucks, what’s the fix? You already have a lottery system. You want a play in tournament for the first few picks? Good luck getting owners and players to agree to play in even more games when they had to make rules to give the MVP to a player that plays most of the season. \n\nEvery suggestion I’ve seen has been terrible. A bunch of them are asinine like why don’t we take all the eligible players in the draft and put their names in a hat and have a team representative pick blindfolded and that’s the player they get.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qz8tjr", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "wetcornbread", "score": 0, "comments": 49, "created_utc": 1770557052.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770829322, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "4785f16c7b9f98bf38604534b50de9b5ed8b4807", "source": "reddit", "title": "Why has NBA fandom become more about rings than enjoying regular-season basketball?", "body": "This post from r/nbadiscussion is getting significant traction with 277 upvotes and 155 comments. I’ve been thinking about this for a while, and I’m genuinely confused about why NBA fandom has become so ring-obsessed that it almost ignores the product most fans actually consume.\n\nMost fans are not front-office analysts. We’re not running championship probability models or thinking in terms of “windows.” We’re people who live in a city, buy tickets, and plan weekends around games. For us, the regular season isn’t filler, it is the product.\n\nTake the recent Cleveland Cavaliers teams. They’ve had strong regular-season records, a clear identity, young talent, and they play competitive basketball most nights. The arena is engaged, the team feels alive, and fans have something to look forward to week after week. From a fan-experience standpoint, that feels like success.\n\nOr take the Giannis-led Milwaukee Bucks over multiple seasons. Even outside the championship year, those teams consistently won a lot of regular-season games, had stars playing most nights, and gave local fans a high-quality product across the year. Yet even with that, seasons that ended short of a deep playoff run were quickly reframed as disappointments or failures.\n\nThat disconnect is what bothers me.\n\nA 50-win team that plays hard, has continuity, and gives fans meaningful games for 6–7 months is now treated as “stuck” or “useless” if it doesn’t make a conference finals or Finals. Front offices respond by dismantling good, watchable teams in the name of chasing a title that only one team wins anyway.\n\nFrom a fan perspective, that logic feels broken.\n\nThe parade lasts one day.\n\nThe season lasts eight months.\n\nWhy should I, as someone who actually attends games and watches weekly, accept a worse regular-season product now for a hypothetical payoff later? Why should I be happy with stars sitting, effort being managed, or teams pivoting toward tanking, all so the franchise can say it “maximized its championship odds”?\n\nWhat makes this worse is how ring culture trains fans to think like executives instead of fans. We stop asking “Was that a good basketball game?” and start asking “Does this translate in the playoffs?” We start defending decisions that make the regular season less enjoyable because media narratives tell us anything short of a title is meaningless.\n\nBut that framing benefits front offices, media debates, and legacy arguments, not the people in the arena on a random Friday night.\n\nEven good teams aren’t allowed to just be good anymore. If you’re not a championship team, you’re expected to either blow it up or radically reshape, which leads to endless cycles of rebuilding, short contention windows, and little continuity. The result is a league where your favorite team is either all-in for a ring or bad at everything else, with very little space for sustained, enjoyable competitiveness.\n\nI’m not saying championships don’t matter. Of course they do. But when the pursuit of rings starts devaluing the majority of games fans actually watch, something feels off.\n\nWhy can’t the default goal be: play hard, be competitive, build continuity, and give fans something to enjoy every other week, and if a championship eventually comes, great? Why does everything have to be judged only at the very end?\n\nGenuinely curious: at what point did NBA fandom stop being about enjoying basketball and start being about auditing legacies?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qyhs5k", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Kitchen_Pomegranate7", "score": 277, "comments": 155, "created_utc": 1770480723.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770829323, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "c5465be534a1469529bce0058ac49e6a7152e919", "source": "reddit", "title": "Did big men stop being skilled in the 2010s, or were they just as skilled in the previous eras, but made obsolete by stretch bigs", "body": "This post from r/nbadiscussion is getting significant traction with 231 upvotes and 116 comments.

People say tanking is \"bad for the fans\", but if you're a fan of a tanking team, you are most likely ACTIVELY rooting for them to lose\n\n2. If you willingly spend time and money watching or attending a Jazz, Kings, Pelicans etc. game late in the season, you know what you're getting yourself into, so I doubt you'd complain if your team's best players sit out\n\n3. Tanking teams almost NEVER play on national TV. Teams get fined if they load manage their best players when they play on national TV, but if the only people watching your game are those fans who are probably rooting for you to lose, how is that a big deal?\n\n4. The NFL, which every league in America is falling over itself trying to copy, has BLATANT tanking, and nobody seems to care. When the Raiders were completely phoning it in this season, I didn't hear anyone complain they were \"ruining the integrity of the league\". Same in baseball, when during the final two months of the season (post deadline) a solid third of the teams are playing tons of anonymous minor leaguers\n\n5. I know everyone's on high alert with gambling scandals, but if you're betting on a tanking team to win a game, that's sort of on you buddy\n\n  \nNow do I wish every team would go all out 100% and try to win every game? Of course. And is it frustrating if you buy tickets to see a tanking team because you like one of their players, and they are held out? Absolutely.

He knew management wanted to ding him for missing a team-requested event and alert him that someone around him was taking too much food from the family room. The gripes between player and organization, as multiple sources said, had become \"petty\" in the fifth year of a relationship many believed should've ended years before. \n\n&gt; Kerr never had much success reaching Kuminga on a deeper level, typically one of his coaching superpowers. He'd given him handwritten notes, sent long text messages, tried to connect. But Kuminga rarely reciprocated. Kuminga normally responded dispassionately and sporadically. \n\n&gt; Inside Kerr's office that afternoon, exasperation boiled over. The discussion went from small picture to bigger picture. Frustrations were let out on both sides -- Kerr voicing his displeasure with Kuminga's lack of buy-in and competitiveness toward the team goals and Kuminga letting out his hurt about Kerr's longtime lack of belief in him as a player. \n\n&gt; The meeting ended, sources familiar with the exchange said, with Kerr slamming his white board in frustration. Kuminga, incidentally, then went out and delivered what Kerr would later describe as two of the most passionate practices he'd seen from him, running the floor, attacking the paint, defending with force.\n\nSource: https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/47880753/inside-ugly-5-year-split-jonathan-kuminga-warriors", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r23dp4", "subreddit": "nba", "author": "JoeBiden2020FTW", "score": 2, "comments": 0, "created_utc": 1770830370.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770830436, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "6b46416e352bd287e65fff4946306cb170759113", "source": "reddit", "title": "Evan Turner: \"I remember one time my coach said he viewed me as Richard Jefferson and that was the first time i truly understood Latrell Spreewell.

They can have their own lottery process to see who gets which.  You still probably get a good player if you’re good at scouting, maybe even the best player in some drafts, but you don’t get a chance at the big fish.\n\nIt stops long-term tanking because no longer can you be as bad as possible and hope for the best.  There is no way to sit there on September and plot how you can finish 5th-worst, let alone have a 3-year tank plan.\n\nIt curbs the most unwatchable spring tanking because teams will fight to get out of that bottom-4.  Players don’t care about picks but FOs do and they’re the ones who tank.  Guys will play.\n\nNow that you’ve removed the teams with the 4 best odds, you can redistribute those odds(54.5%) amongst the 10 teams left in the lottery process and have a much gentler slope in winning probability.  I don’t want it flat, it is there to help the cycle of losing to winning, but more gentle.\n\nRight now the best odds of winning are 14% for teams 1-3, odds for 7th- worst are 7.5%, odds for 14th are 0.5%.\n\n \n\nI propose:\n\n\\#5 - 13%\n\n\\#6 - 12.5%\n\n\\#7 - 12%\n\n\\#8 - 11.5%\n\n\\#9 - 11%\n\n\\#10 - 10%\n\n\\#11 - 9%\n\n\\#12 - 8%\n\n\\#13 - 7%\n\n\\#14 - 6%\n\nSo you can try to make the playoffs and still have a shot at #1, you’d have the same odds of winning as the current #8 team, meanwhile the best odds are about the same, and the best odds are a bit more than twice the worst.\n\nMiddle teams tanking to get to #5 but not #4 with the bottom teams trying to win, ok, good luck- there will still be a couple shenanigans there but nowhere close to what we’ve got now.\n\nLong-term tanking gone, short-term tanking seriously curbed, incentives to try and win everywhere.

Affect the Owner.", "body": "A system of promotion and relegation will never be seen in the NBA (or any other US-based sports league). Yet a system that financially incentives winning directly is still the best way to ensure that all franchises try and win. And, IMO, it's a far simpler and more effective way to curb tanking and improve regular season competitiveness than further tinkering with draft lottery rules.\n\nNBA teams earn revenues from a variety of sources. These include:\n\n\n\n* Gameday &amp; Arena Operations (tickets, concessions, parking, etc.)\n\n\n\n* Team Sponsorships (jerseys, arena ads, corporate partnerships, etc.)\n\n\n\n* Local TV media rights\n\n\n\n* National TV media rights\n\n\n\n* League Sponsorships\n\n\n\n* Merchandise\n\n\n\n* Revenue Sharing (additive for lower-revenue teams, negative for higher-revenue teams)\n\nNational TV revenues - the contracts from ESPN/ABC, Amazon, et al. - account for [approximately 40% of total team revenues](https://www.sportico.com/leagues/basketball/2025/how-nba-teams-owners-make-money-1234874170/), and that revenue gets split evenly for every team.\n\nWant a fix for tanking? Want to make the regular season more meaningful, and even curb load management rest days? Allocate the national tv revenues by wins across the league rather than to each team equally. Currently, each team earns approximately $143mm this season for that deal, and that amount will increase by 7% for the next 11 years. That means the national tv deal this season is paying approximately $4.3b to the league. Each NBA season has 1,230 wins, so each win would earn the franchise approximately $3.5mm. A 60-win team is earning the franchise approximately $210mm. A 20 win team would earn just 1/3 of that, only $70mm. That is a drastic difference in revenues, enriching the successful team and harming the losing one.\n\nWhy do I think this move works?\n\nThis change adds a very real cost to teams that are actively harming the league. In economic terms, this sort of change helps reduce the Free Rider problem, wherein teams that are actively trying to lose (and therefore do not provide value to the NBA and its media partners, or even provide negative value) are benefiting from teams that are oriented towards winning. This change promotes a sense of fairness; media partners are paying for the right to broadcast good, winning teams.\n\nThere's already an indirect cost to losing. Your gameday operations revenues fall (fewer ticket sales, lower-priced tickets, etc.), your sponsorships and local tv deals are likely lower in the long run, etc. Your 'brand' as a franchise is harmed. But this type of change adds a direct cost to the billionaire owners who so often indifferently run their teams. Committing to a multi-year rebuild and tank is asking an owner to eat losses of $100mm or more. I don't think many owners are willing to pay that cost, despite many having the resources to do so.\n\nI also don't think NBA teams operate with the margins to support these kinds of losses, particularly in the intermediate and long term. A team that repeatedly loses 50+ games should be looked at as a failed business. Businesses that are repeatedly losing money (that are in the mature stage, not overspending to fund growth) cut back on staff, lose talent to competitors, etc. A losing or tanking team should lose its scouting and front office staff, coaches, trainers, et al. to other franchises that are more successful. The national media share is not the majority of an average team's revenues - a losing season or two is not a death knell to an organization - but there would be a real cost to failing. And, IMO, this type of change would completely eliminate the incentive for teams to intentionally fail.\n\nYou'd also see churn amongst bad teams with unsuccessful owners. Vivek Ranadive would've sold the team by now given all of Sacramento's losing. Congrats to the Kings' fans. Ryan Smith is not okaying four years of tanking. Congrats to the Jazz fans (who I know are defensive about their team's tanking). Etc. etc. etc.\n\ntldr? The league is better when teams are incentivized to win. Adding a direct cost to franchises that are losing helps ensure that all teams are competitive. I don't think even the wealthiest owners are going to accept several years of tens of millions of dollars in losses, hoping to win a (literal) lottery ticket.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r28lzq", "subreddit": "nba", "author": "Handcuffed", "score": 0, "comments": 17, "created_utc": 1770841675.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770846584, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "e951e885315fac404c20f609d4d5e616d5301004", "source": "reddit", "title": "r/nba Community Home", "body": "This post contains content not supported on old Reddit.

He knew management wanted to ding him for missing a team-requested event and alert him that someone around him was taking too much food from the family room. The gripes between player and organization, as multiple sources said, had become \"petty\" in the fifth year of a relationship many believed should've ended years before. \n\n&gt; Kerr never had much success reaching Kuminga on a deeper level, typically one of his coaching superpowers. He'd given him handwritten notes, sent long text messages, tried to connect. But Kuminga rarely reciprocated. Kuminga normally responded dispassionately and sporadically. \n\n&gt; Inside Kerr's office that afternoon, exasperation boiled over. The discussion went from small picture to bigger picture. Frustrations were let out on both sides -- Kerr voicing his displeasure with Kuminga's lack of buy-in and competitiveness toward the team goals and Kuminga letting out his hurt about Kerr's longtime lack of belief in him as a player. \n\n&gt; The meeting ended, sources familiar with the exchange said, with Kerr slamming his white board in frustration.

These were the two seasons MJ and Lebron were probably at their best in terms of shooting, and the point in their ages and careers where they were less reliant on their athleticism and therefore needed to compensate with more shooting. Since Lebron did not make the playoffs due to injury in 18-19, and Jordan's stats in 95-96 are unavailable, I couldnt exactly line up the ages.\n\nWhile there are some data collected by fans on Jordan between 90-92, it is incomplete and arguably cherry picked, as one commenter in the following reddit post argues\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/16lg95i/according\\_to\\_tracking\\_stats\\_michael\\_jordan\\_was/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/16lg95i/according_to_tracking_stats_michael_jordan_was/)\n\nI would tend to agree that it is cherry picked. Not necessarily only because the fans at RealGM intentionally chose the best of Jordan's games, but also possibly because only his best games are the ones fans collect, and therefore there is a survivorship bias on collected footage.\n\nObviously, based on the question of this post, this is a type of question that is opinion based, and unfalsifiable. But to me it is interesting, and it is a fair question to ask which is more effective as a playstyle archetype.\n\nMy primary focus on this post is on playstyles, not to karma farm and spark a GOAT debate in violation of r/nbadiscussion rules.\n\n**My belief** is that Lebron's shot selection is not an indictment on his shooting ability (esp. as it related to Jordan), but rather a deliberate analytics driven choice to maximize high% shots and therefore if he played in the 90s, and played more \"like Mike\", Lebron's resulting midrange fg% would not have changed dramatically, especially given he would have needed to practice it more to adapt to 90s basketball. \n\nFurther I would argue that if MJ played in the modern era, his shot selection would also have become similar to Lebron's with more attempts at the rim, and less midrange and more 3s. It could be argued, that MJ's midrange % would suffer but his 3pt% would improve as both skills do not seem to be entirely transferable, that is, practicing the middy doesn't necessarily make you a better 3pt shooter and vice versa.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0sku7", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Single-Purpose-7608", "score": 45, "comments": 43, "created_utc": 1770702261.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770846587, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "cec57a9795af486263f7a8ee8996caa69fd285f1", "source": "reddit", "title": "2025-26 Midseason Player Evaluations: Who are the best players in the NBA?", "body": "Over the last decade I’ve worked in data analytics environments and applied inferential statistical methods both inside and outside basketball contexts. Alongside that, I’ve built and maintained a historical database of graded high-impact NBA player seasons that I use for cross-era evaluation.\n\nAt this point, I’ve graded roughly the top 10–15 players from each of the last \\~40 NBA seasons (≈600 player-seasons total). The goal wasn’t just to build ranking lists, but rather to build a stable impact magnitude scale across eras. I periodically revisit those seasons as my framework improves to keep the scale internally consistent. When I evaluate current players, I’m placing them relative to that historical anchor map rather than evaluating them in isolation.\n\nMethodologically, this sits somewhere between pure modeling and pure scouting. I’m not running a single formula and publishing whatever number comes out. Instead, I use a triangulation process across multiple evidence streams and then map that combined signal onto historically calibrated impact tiers.\n\n# The Core Question\n\nThe central question I’m trying to approximate is:\n\n**What is this player’s intrinsic basketball impact level?**\n\nMore concretely:\n\n**If you added this player to a random NBA team, how much would he increase that team’s probability of winning a championship?**\n\nThis matters because value measured strictly within one team context is heavily influenced by role, roster construction, redundancy, coaching scheme, usage environment, and numerous other factors independent of a player's true level. Two players can generate similar impact signals on one roster while having very different portability across the league as a whole. So, how a player retains his value on different types of teams, not just the one he happens to be on, is important. The goal is to approximate a player’s average impact across many plausible team environments, not just the one he currently happens to be in.\n\n# How I Approximate That\n\nThe evaluation is a synthesis of several signal layers:\n\n**Impact metrics**  \nRAPM-family signals, possession-value box models, lineup and on/off data. These provide directional and magnitude signal but are always interpreted in context.\n\n**Film and mechanism evaluation**  \nFilm helps determine how impact is being generated and how likely it is to translate across defensive schemes and playoff environments.\n\n**Multi-year signal stabilization**  \nSingle-season spikes are treated cautiously unless supported by mechanism and historical precedent. To avoid drowning in statistical noise, it's important to use evidence from surrounding seasons to inform this season's valuation.\n\n**Contextual Factors**  \nSome skill packages historically maintain impact more consistently across team constructions, matchups, and playoff environments. Three big questions here: (1) how well does a player retain his value when paired with other high level teammates, and how well does he allow them to retain their value? (2) how well does a player's portfolio of skills translate to the style of play we see in playoff environments? (3) what other contextual factors (role, team construction, coaching, redundancies or lack thereof) might be inflating or suppressing the metrics beyond what we'd see from the player on a random team?\n\n**Historical calibration**  \nMy 600-season database is used to anchor magnitude. New seasons are placed relative to known historical impact clusters.\n\n# Midseason Context\n\nThese are midseason point estimates. I will calculate the final season version after the playoffs wrap up, and this will include explicit uncertainty ranges.\n\nAt this point in the season, tier placement and broad ordering tend to stabilize earlier than exact magnitude. Midseason estimates are anchored to prior full-season calibrated levels and adjusted based on current-season evidence so far.\n\n# Interpretive Scale for Net Valuations\n\n7.0+ → GOAT-level peak (≈ top 2–3 peaks ever)  \n6.0+ → All-time great peak (≈ top \\~10 peaks ever)  \n5.4–6.0 → Strong MVP level  \n4.6–5.4 → Solid MVP level  \n4.0–4.6 → Weak MVP level  \n3.0+ → Solid All-NBA level  \n1.5+ → All-Star level\n\nImpact estimates are (roughly) measured in points per game of impact contribution to a random team, adjusted to calibrate the proxy to added championship probability.\n\n# 2025–26 Midseason Snapshot\n\n\\~14 players considered for this exercise as candidates for the top 10 spots; assumes full health\n\n* format: Player X (point estimates for impact: OFF, DEF, NET)\n\n# Locks\n\nNikola Jokic — (6.2, 0.2, 6.4)  \nShai Gilgeous-Alexander — (5.0, 0.6, 5.6)  \nGiannis Antetokounmpo — (3.5, 1.4, 4.9)  \nVictor Wembanyama — (1.7, 3.0, 4.7)  \nStephen Curry — (4.4, -0.2, 4.2)\n\n# Near Locks / Very Strong Candidates\n\nLuka Doncic — (4.0, -0.3, 3.7)  \nKawhi Leonard — (3.1, 0.5, 3.6)  \nCade Cunningham — (2.9, 0.7, 3.6)\n\n# Remaining Candidates\n\n(Heavy confidence interval overlap, difficult to cleanly rank)\n\nTyrese Maxey — (3.3, 0.0, 3.3)  \nJalen Brunson — (3.6, -0.4, 3.2)  \nJamal Murray — (3.4, -0.3, 3.1)  \nAnthony Edwards — (2.7, 0.4, 3.1)  \nJaylen Brown — (2.8, 0.3, 3.1)  \nDonovan Mitchell — (3.3, -0.3, 3.0)\n\n— Top-10 candidate line —\n\nIf forced to add one more today:  \nChet Holmgren — (0.5, 2.3, 2.8)\n\nHappy to answer questions about methodology or discuss specific players.

So let’s talk now about what McCain has done this season and what OKC might be getting.\n\n**Danny:**\n\nI have been fascinated with McCain because I thought he was the best rookie last year before he went down. It was a small sample. He played fewer than 600 minutes last year for the Sixers and then came back this year.\n\nHe’s actually now with the little bit of time at the end with Sixers and OKC. He’s now played more minutes this year than he did last year, fewer per game. But that’s partially due to change in role.\n\nAnd so at first, the numbers for McCain were truly terrible on both ends of both parts of offense, the threes and the twos. But his three pointer has gotten back to where it was, which is very encouraging for McCain and for the Thunder. So last year was 38.3 percent on eight per 36.\n\nNow he’s 38 percent on seven per 36. So we’re getting into the same ballpark there. I believe that his three pointer was going to improve back.\n\nBut that wasn’t the thing in the film that really spooked me. Instead, it was the inside the arc game. And those numbers on that are still pretty putrid.\n\nSo last year, Jared McCain converted 53 percent of his twos and was taking them at a reasonable volume. This year, that’s down to 39 percent. And there are a lot of different troubling things there.\n\nEven with the stats, some of this you expect to improve. So his simple strike quality is actually better this year than last year, but his shot making is way down. His contested finishing is at 43 percent, which is horrendous, doing really poorly on the self-created stuff.\n\nAnd so that made me really want to dig into the film. And like I said, I thought that the three-pointer looked totally fine both last year and this year. I wasn’t worried in the early part of the season when McCain was shooting 32 percent.\n\nIt just didn’t seem like that was anything real. But the half court film for this year is terrible. And I’m hoping and expecting that this is injury related.\n\nSo there were a couple of plays where he either couldn’t beat his guys, and I mean, Hugo Gonzalez is not a bad defender, we just talked about in the length. But there was a play where McCain couldn’t beat him on a drive, settled for a bad mid ranger and missed. But then the plays that were more concerning were the ones where he had some sort of an advantage, but then it still didn’t produce anything.\n\nThere was one where, against the Mavs, where Ryan Nemhard got screened and was still able to recover from the screen to get back to Jared McCain. McCain tried to do the WNBA step through, which did get him a better look. But that sort of play was like a guy gets screened and can still recover to you.\n\nAnd I just didn’t see any pop for him in the half court or really in transition. And now, part of it for McCain is that he looks Maxey and VJ Edgecombe are just such talented athletes that you’re the other guy that looks like you’re slow motion there. But he also wasn’t that great an athlete to begin with.\n\nAnd another one of those limited defensive plays was that there was one against the Knicks, where Tyler Kolek came out to pressure right around half court. And Jared McCain just traveled. And like Jared McCain last year, he did all that.\n\nPart of the reason I was so encouraged with him was because he had a 25% usage rate. Like he was doing a lot with the ball in his hands. He’s just been out of sorts.\n\nBut the good news, and I see it as mostly good news for The Thunder, is that when you consider that this is his age 21 season, the things that look off on Jared McCain, and they look so off that I actually went back and watched some of his 2024-25 film to just see if he was a different player. And my answer was yes. I think that he did look more aggressive.\n\nNow, he’s never been a great athlete. But getting, some people talk a lot about how, and this is true to an extent, oh, it’s so bad when a hyper-athletic guy loses a step. And that’s true.\n\nBut it’s in some ways even more damaging when a less athletic guy loses a half step or a full step, because then they just don’t have any advantages anymore. And so I think that based on the injuries he’s had, my inclination is that this is a temporary thing. And I mean, it was encouraging that in the Thunder game against the Rockets, McCain plus 12 in the 14 minutes he played, that was a, the Thunder had some weird on-off was in that one.\n\nGot it, made a three, was one for three from two. But the crux of it is like basically can McCain, we know the three-pointers already bounced back, but even with that bouncing back, because he’s not getting to the line anymore, lower usage, and he’s not 39% on twos, is that real? And so I think that he can get back to where he was.\n\nBut the film is truly awful.\n\n**Nate:**\n\nYeah, I thought he looked heavy when he came back, but there wasn’t a great excuse for that, because remember, he had the thumb issue as well, and he had been out really since November of last year. Now he had the meniscus repair, and that definitely can bother guys to be sure, but ultimately, it shouldn’t be as bad as something like an ACL necessarily. So I am concerned.\n\nI also just don’t quite see how he fits in. And Daryl Morey said basically, he was pretty forthright, I would say, when he said, I am confident that we sold high on him. We got a package back that was commensurate with a high level of starter.\n\n**Danny:**\n\nBy the way, I love the thing that the pick that Daryl Morey got back was a pick that Daryl Morey traded, because it was a pick that the Rockets sent away years ago.\n\n**Nate:**\n\nIn the Westbrook deal. That is pretty good. But I think Morey is probably going to be right.\n\nAnd I know there is some angst in Sixers. Dan linked to the Liberty Ballers piece about how the Sixers just got out of the tax. And Daryl was saying they were going to try to move that pick that they got for something else and just nothing materialized.\n\nAnd they did allow themselves to give Dom Barlow more than the minimum going forward, which they needed to do. Getting him under contract for the future I think is important. And I don’t know that there was a move out there that would have made a ton of sense for the Sixers.\n\nThough it’s worth noting too that they were not first apron hard capped either. Now they would have been hard capped to the first apron if they took on money. So I don’t know that there was some great move there.\n\nIt is, of course, noteworthy that they always seem to get out of the tax. Darryl always seems to get his teams out of the tax. Not that he’s working for owners who probably at least he knows that they would appreciate that.\n\nSo I think these assets will be useful for Philly going forward because there was this first and then they got what, two seconds as well that were decent seconds.\n\n**Danny:**\n\nThey got, basically it’ll be the more favorable of Indiana, Miami, OKC and Houston for 27. So I mean, they could all be competitive, but I expect at least one of those teams won’t be. And then they have Milwaukee in 28, depending on what happens with Giannis Antetokounmpo could be pretty good.\n\n**Nate:**\n\nYeah, if he stays there, that pick could be pretty decent for. Yeah, I think so. I like could he I just can’t really imagine Jared McCain being a starter.\n\n**Danny:**\n\nHe’s a good enough shooter that I think on a real team, right?\n\n**Nate:**\n\nOn a on a OKC level of team.\n\n**Danny:**\n\nYeah, well, maybe not an OKC level team, but on a team that could win a playoff series. It’s you would need a lot of other players to do a lot of good things around him. And that’s always been the case.\n\nI mean, I was I was I think higher on him than some going into that draft. That was the draft for a scout of a billion guys. But it was still always that idea of like he could be a good version of this player, but a great version is going to need him to be a superlative shooter.\n\nAnd I think he’s a very good one. And so how do you harness that? We’ve seen a lot of these like better shooters than they are athlete guys get to a certain level, but then not break through.\n\nBut then guys who are way better athletes like his now former teammates. Like those guys can push.

It devalues your draft picks and risks injury of your stars. Isolating a single game, it is pretty significantly a bad value proposition to try to win. That is, unless you go deep in the playoffs or even win a championship. This is the thesis statement for tanking. And honestly, no clever trick or interesting rule has changed or will change that. If winning becomes a positive value, then you obviously have a positive feedback loop where good teams get value and losing teams lose value. As a result, any plan to fix tanking by making tanking less favorable will automatically make the balancing function between good and bad teams weaker, which is an essential aspect of the parity in the sport.\n\nSo for any solution, it seems like there are two major ways to truly end tanking: take wins and losses out of the equation or give the worst teams some assets that are more valuable on truly bad teams than they are on teams that are pretending to be bad. An extreme example of the former is literally why having a committee that decides who are truly the worst teams, factoring in sketchy tactics, strength of schedule, basically the reverse college sports ranking system and have that decide the lottery. The latter is a bit difficult to pin down. Ultimately, everybody needs talent. Good teams need talent. Bad teams need talent. Trade or salary exemptions are pretty important for everybody. Maybe something that can give teams more dart throws of talent? Like some eased restrictions or exceptions on trades that return more players than it sends for the teams at the bottom of the standings? This is definitely something that would need more thoughts.\n\nI'm not really positing a specific rule change to eliminate tanking, but I feel like I see a lot of threads that fall into the two obvious traps of neither actually flipping the script on wins having a significant negative value to non-contenders nor avoiding a situation where the worst teams stay losing.\n\nLet me know what you all think!", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qzujwb", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Round-Walrus3175", "score": 84, "comments": 60, "created_utc": 1770611234.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770846588, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "962a91703afb20232d0d3894fa3ba83124ef0448", "source": "reddit", "title": "I don’t get the hate for “tanking” and ultimately it gives the NBA more parity than any other sports league (of the big 4 in America.)", "body": "I see a lot of people trying to come up with solutions to prevent tanking (purposely throwing games to get a higher overall pick.) \n\nIn the moment it sort of sucks if you follow a team day in and day out knowing they’re going to lose. But it’s the same thing if they genuinely suck. But it’s better for the NBA to have a team that’s mediocre tank to become competitive than a team that’s outright terrible year after year. \n\nCompare it to other sports. In the NFL there’s no lottery. The worst team gets the first pick. Yet, the same few teams dominate every year. Since 2011 every AFC championship game has had either the Patriots or Chiefs in it. I think coaching and general management/ownership impacts winning more than talent in the NFL. The best player in NFL history was a 6th overall pick. \n\nMatthew Stafford was a first overall pick and didn’t win squat with the Lions. Traded to the Rams and within a few seasons has a Super Bowl ring and MVP. All because he’s coached by an elite offensive coach. If you have bad ownership and bad coaching  you can have all the talent imaginable and you won’t win anything. The Jets, Browns, Raiders, etc.  \n\nNow look at the MLB. The Dodgers are well on their way to winning a third consecutive championship. And they’d have even more if they didn’t get screwed by cheaters in the WS back to back years in 2017 and 2018. Basically the rest of the teams are competing to be either the 2nd best NL team or for an American League pennant. The only team in recent memory that succeeded in tanking is the Astros and they cheated for one of their two championships. Teams that suck in baseball suck because their owners are penny pinchers. Even if they get elite draft picks they’ll just be traded or signed to a mega deal by a World Series contender once their contract is over. Paul Skenes is a good example. \n\nSure there’s “dynasties” in the NBA but nothing compared to the NFL, for example. The Warriors are the latest example. But Steph Curry only has 4 rings and has been playing since 2009. Mahomes already has 3 super bowls and started playing in 2018. \n\nPeople complain about tanking but will wear the jersey of the super star they wound up getting in the draft and when they win the championship they’ll forget their team even did it. People were up in arms over the Luka trade last year and the Mavs wound up getting Cooper Flagg because of it. And Luka hasn’t done anything with the Lakers. \n\n“It’s not fair to the fans that pay for tickets to see stars get pulled.”\n\nNot a real argument in a league that has random rest days and load management even for the elite teams. And if the team they paid to see sucks they only spent less than $50 for good seats on a ticket anyways. Total crapshoot on who you’re going to see play on any given day. \n\nWhy would owners risk whatever star players they have getting injured in ultimately meaningless games? Even if they don’t win because of the top overall pick, the revenue and ticket sales they get the following season are well worth it.\n\nAnd if you genuinely think tanking sucks, what’s the fix? You already have a lottery system. You want a play in tournament for the first few picks? Good luck getting owners and players to agree to play in even more games when they had to make rules to give the MVP to a player that plays most of the season. \n\nEvery suggestion I’ve seen has been terrible. A bunch of them are asinine like why don’t we take all the eligible players in the draft and put their names in a hat and have a team representative pick blindfolded and that’s the player they get.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qz8tjr", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "wetcornbread", "score": 0, "comments": 50, "created_utc": 1770557052.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770846588, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "826a2eeb21e319e226399385754b99ab43337a3a", "source": "reddit", "title": "Why has NBA fandom become more about rings than enjoying regular-season basketball?", "body": "This post from r/nbadiscussion is getting significant traction with 279 upvotes and 155 comments. I’ve been thinking about this for a while, and I’m genuinely confused about why NBA fandom has become so ring-obsessed that it almost ignores the product most fans actually consume.\n\nMost fans are not front-office analysts. We’re not running championship probability models or thinking in terms of “windows.” We’re people who live in a city, buy tickets, and plan weekends around games. For us, the regular season isn’t filler, it is the product.\n\nTake the recent Cleveland Cavaliers teams. They’ve had strong regular-season records, a clear identity, young talent, and they play competitive basketball most nights. The arena is engaged, the team feels alive, and fans have something to look forward to week after week. From a fan-experience standpoint, that feels like success.\n\nOr take the Giannis-led Milwaukee Bucks over multiple seasons. Even outside the championship year, those teams consistently won a lot of regular-season games, had stars playing most nights, and gave local fans a high-quality product across the year. Yet even with that, seasons that ended short of a deep playoff run were quickly reframed as disappointments or failures.\n\nThat disconnect is what bothers me.\n\nA 50-win team that plays hard, has continuity, and gives fans meaningful games for 6–7 months is now treated as “stuck” or “useless” if it doesn’t make a conference finals or Finals. Front offices respond by dismantling good, watchable teams in the name of chasing a title that only one team wins anyway.\n\nFrom a fan perspective, that logic feels broken.\n\nThe parade lasts one day.\n\nThe season lasts eight months.\n\nWhy should I, as someone who actually attends games and watches weekly, accept a worse regular-season product now for a hypothetical payoff later? Why should I be happy with stars sitting, effort being managed, or teams pivoting toward tanking, all so the franchise can say it “maximized its championship odds”?\n\nWhat makes this worse is how ring culture trains fans to think like executives instead of fans. We stop asking “Was that a good basketball game?” and start asking “Does this translate in the playoffs?” We start defending decisions that make the regular season less enjoyable because media narratives tell us anything short of a title is meaningless.\n\nBut that framing benefits front offices, media debates, and legacy arguments, not the people in the arena on a random Friday night.\n\nEven good teams aren’t allowed to just be good anymore. If you’re not a championship team, you’re expected to either blow it up or radically reshape, which leads to endless cycles of rebuilding, short contention windows, and little continuity. The result is a league where your favorite team is either all-in for a ring or bad at everything else, with very little space for sustained, enjoyable competitiveness.\n\nI’m not saying championships don’t matter. Of course they do. But when the pursuit of rings starts devaluing the majority of games fans actually watch, something feels off.\n\nWhy can’t the default goal be: play hard, be competitive, build continuity, and give fans something to enjoy every other week, and if a championship eventually comes, great? Why does everything have to be judged only at the very end?\n\nGenuinely curious: at what point did NBA fandom stop being about enjoying basketball and start being about auditing legacies?", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qyhs5k", "subreddit": "nbadiscussion", "author": "Kitchen_Pomegranate7", "score": 279, "comments": 155, "created_utc": 1770480723.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770846588, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "8a72906b23980d96c65a94f3684843dcb64e3844", "source": "reddit", "title": "Did big men stop being skilled in the 2010s, or were they just as skilled in the previous eras, but made obsolete by stretch bigs", "body": "This post from r/nbadiscussion is getting significant traction with 231 upvotes and 117 comments.
