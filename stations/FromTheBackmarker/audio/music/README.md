# Music Assets

Place theme music variants here:

- **theme_minor.ogg** - Minor key variant (struggling, despair, -1.0 to -0.4 performance)
- **theme_neutral.ogg** - Neutral variant (holding on, -0.4 to +0.4 performance)
- **theme_major.ogg** - Major key variant (outperforming, hope, +0.4 to +1.0 performance)

## Technical Requirements

- **Format**: OGG Vorbis (for compression and seamless looping)
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1 kHz
- **Bitrate**: 128-192 kbps
- **Duration**: 2-4 minutes minimum (will loop)
- **Loop Points**: Clean loop from end back to beginning

## Musical Direction

All three should be recognizable as variations of the same theme:

- **Harmonic DNA**: Same melodic motifs, different modal colors
- **Minor**: Aeolian/Phrygian - darker thirds, flatter sevenths, more tension
- **Neutral**: Dorian/Aeolian-adjacent - balanced, contemplative
- **Major**: Ionian/Lydian - brighter thirds, open intervals, more space

The system will smoothly crossfade between variants over 6 seconds as team performance changes.

## Audio Processing

Optional real-time DSP (future enhancement):
- Filter cutoff adjustment (brightness)
- Reverb send (space = hope, dry = struggle)
- Volume envelope (louder when optimistic)

## Sources

Consider:
- Library music (Artlist, Epidemic Sound, AudioJungle)
- Custom composition with modal variations
- AI music generation tools with stem export
- Hire composer for proper modal drift versions
