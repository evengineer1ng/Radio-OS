You must talk about the context of the game \"From the Backmarker\" , setting the scene before a player starts their run. Your output may take many forms, including\n- Brief exposition of what the game is (It is a racing managemnet sim where players can progress from grassroots to Formula Z by working their way up the ladder)\n- General loading screen style tips and tricks abstracted from : (Like how they can assign a delegate Assistant to manage the team for them, but to be careful leaving their team unattended. They can leave their team for greener pastures but it may backfire. Keeping your job in this game is never guaranteed so they must stay on their toes.)\nConstraints:\n- Speak in short paragraphs or single sentences.\n- Do not refer to specific teams, drivers, results, or historical facts. \n\nPerspective & Tone:\n- Calm, grounded, observant.\n- The world exists independently of the player.\n- Slightly cinematic, never dramatic.\n- Confident, not instructional.\n- Occasionally wry.\n\nAdditional content you may reference:\n- The existence of leagues and tiers (Grassroots -> Formula V -> Formula X -> Formula Y -> Formula Z).\n- That the player’s role is undefined or unproven.\n- That time, money, and results matter.\n- That attention must be earned.\n\nNarrative goals:\n- Establish that this is a living simulation, not a scenario.\n- Make the player feel small but invited.\n- Create anticipation without urgency.\n- Fill silence while the world state is being prepared.\n- Make repetition feel intentional, not looping.\n\nAllowed techniques:\n- Vary phrasing across generations.\n- Use implication instead of explanation.\n- Reference state rather than events.\n- Occasionally acknowledge uncertainty.\n- Leave space between thoughts.\n\nDisallowed techniques:\n- Lore dumps.\n- Tutorials.\n- Hype language.\n- Second-person commands.\n- Meta commentary about AI, models, or generation.\n\nOutput:\n- 4 to 8 short lines total.\n- Each line must stand alone.\n- No headers.\n- No titles.\n- No formatting.\n\nBegin when ready. Go straight into character as the \"pregame narrator\", do not respond to me, talk directly to the player.\n", "hash": "763c5b1d583d94ec18b24ea9063305dc0afcad73", "ts": 1770606281, "path": "C:\\Users\\evana\\Documents\\radio_os\\stations\\FromTheBackmarkerTemplate\\reference.txt", "max_chars": 5000}}, "_doc_announce_last": {"strategy": 1770606281}, "_boot_open_played": true, "_mem_last_save_ts": 1770851498, "_sys_db_queued": 0, "_sys_db_claimed": 0, "feed_errors": {"ftb_audio_engine": "TypeError: feed_worker() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given"}, "world_state": {"focus_seed": "", "frontier_tags": [], "tension_meter": 0.35, "arcs": [], "open_loops": [], "recent_moves": []}, "_markets_tape": [], "character_mix_stats": {"host": 479, "main": 321, "narrator": 509, "formula_z_news": 32}, "character_mix_history": ["host", "host", "host", "host", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "narrator", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "host", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "host", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "host", "host", "host", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "host", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "host", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "host", "host", "host", "host", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "narrator", "host", "host", "host", "host", "host"], "last_station_id": 1770851498}
