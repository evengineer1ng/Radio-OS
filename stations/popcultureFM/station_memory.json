Pay it forward!", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qque3c", "subreddit": "television", "author": "DRL_tfn", "score": 32, "comments": 19, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1769973745, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "af8ce9386be28af4cbac5025e0b85245fef65079", "source": "reddit", "title": "The subjects of Don’t Fuck With Cats pissed me off so much", "body": "Don’t Fuck With Cats is a Netflix documentary about a Facebook group of internet sleuths who tried to find the identity of a guy who posted videos of himself killing cats, and eventually posted a video of himself killing a man.\n\nIt’s gripping for the first episode and a bit, when you still think it’s a story about how these random people helped catch a killer, until the police get involved and you start to realise how useless these online detectives really are. They impress you a couple of times by deducing the location of the killer from his online photographs, but in the end not a single bit of their “sleuthing” helped at all. They didn’t contribute a single thing to his arrest, and if they had never gotten involved, the investigation and capture would have proceeded exactly the same. And the self-congratulatory tone they have had the whole documentary instantly gets a lot less charming when you know they did buggery fuck all.\n\nIn fact, not only did they initially get the wrong man and harass him until he killed himself(!), they only “found” the real culprit because they were so terrible at finding him he just messaged them his own name in the guise of an anonymous tip. Even then, the cops found him from identification papers he left with the body, not because of the group.\n\nAnd the fucking audacity they have to be frustrated at the police for not taking them seriously and tweeting “I told you sos” at them (one gets an entire dramatic recreation of the abuse she tweeted at the cop’s official Twitter account), when none of their information could have prevented the murder and they contributed NOTHING to the investigation or eventual capture. It was the ordinary work of those actual police and Interpol that got him. Meanwhile the murder of the actual victim Jun Lin is a barely-mentioned afterthought to them. The contrast between their reaction to the video of his death vs the genuinely traumatised police detective’s is sickening. You just get such a horrible sense of how they completely trivialised his life cos it was all just a fucking game to them.\n\nAt the end when they’re recalling the killer’s capture, they cheer and hoot like they had fucking anything to do with it. They were of NO value to the police or the victims. All their hours of obsession and they did NOTHING. They did no good for the world. In fact, if they stayed out of it the world would probably be a little bit better. That man they hounded might still be alive, and they would’ve given the killer less of the attention he was desperate for. They only gave him more than he would've gotten otherwise, and got a guy killed.\n\nFor fuck’s sake, they made an entire Facebook group dedicated to the murderer, which they KNEW HE WAS IN, and instead of shutting it down they just kept feeding him the attention like a dedicated audience. He played them and turned them into an attention farm and they’re PROUD of it?? They felt like such clever clogs, but he knew they were rubes who’d keep giving him exactly what he wanted and lavishing attention on him. He knew these pathetic nutcase obsessives were as sick as him, and played on their obsession to feed his own sickness. Just a perfect match of parasites feeding off each other online. They arguably escalated him into the murder, they even mention that briefly, but only to go on about it haunts THEM sometimes. They never seem to question if they should have gotten involved in the first place. They still feel like the plucky little good guys in the end, but you're left with the feeling that there should have been some kind of legal action against them.\n\nAnd in the final line of the documentary, one of these no-life chair-moisteners looks right into the camera and shames the audience for being part of the problem for giving the killer more attention. For watching a whole documentary THEY made about him. I would never have even known his name if they didn’t spend three hours jerking themselves off about how much attention THEY gave him!! They’re literally PROFITING off of him and shaming *everyone else* about it??\n\nWhy do they eat up so much oxygen in this documentary? Why are they the main subjects? They are such a side story compared to the actual professionals. Would it have even been three episodes without them droning on about themselves and their useless pointless busywork so much?\n\nThey thought his arrest was gonna be their big moment, but then they had nothing to do with it, and years later they're still trying to make it *their* moment. These self-important comic book guy dweebs are STILL so nakedly desperate to be recognised despite doing fucking dick. Just pissing around on the internet playing pretend cops and getting NOWHERE. Wanting to feel like heroes for doing NOTHING. Thinking they’re entitled to some kind of pat on the head for all the attention they gave this twat. They just can’t stop giving this guy attention so they can skim some off for themselves. It’s a fucking disgrace.\n\nIt's accidentally the best case against internet vigilantism I've ever seen.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qt0rkz", "subreddit": "television", "author": "The_Man_of_Steel", "score": 664, "comments": 75, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1769973745, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "148944679b12a01abbd50a2f254d2a6750502951", "source": "reddit", "title": "Melania's $40 Million Docu-Bribe Movie Premieres &amp; Dems Make ICE Demands | The Daily Show", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qqtudr", "subreddit": "television", "author": "TheRealOcsiban", "score": 603, "comments": 26, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1769973745, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "e2808e84c8558f7487a458ce04d40500a98b6612", "source": "reddit", "title": "John Turturro Says ‘Severance’ Season 3 Starts Filming in July", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qsyf2y", "subreddit": "television", "author": "MarvelsGrantMan136", "score": 2637, "comments": 396, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1769973745, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "5653b260cb0d387f3ba488d3e29896e43e716dd3", "source": "reddit", "title": "Star Trek: Starfleet Academy - 1x04 - “Vox in Excelso” - Episode Discussion", "body": "#Star Trek: Starfleet Academy\n\n**Season 1 Episode 4**: Vox in Excelso\n\n**Directed by**: Doug Aarniokoski\n\n**Written by**: Gaia Violo &amp; Eric Anthony Glover", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qqsqch", "subreddit": "television", "author": "NicholasCajun", "score": 0, "comments": 39, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1769973745, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "a8f5576b4a80fbe6b0c1f39232979af475056166", "source": "reddit", "title": "Mom Confession - SNL", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qswtli", "subreddit": "television", "author": "snakebit1995", "score": 798, "comments": 80, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1769973745, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "0d9dd1854e6bf9a1cc05cc9038eb97bd2862bab7", "source": "reddit", "title": "The Pitt - 2x04 - 10:00 A.M.\" - Episode Discussion", "body": "#The Pitt\n\n**Season 2 Episode 4**: 10:00 A.M.\n\n**Directed by**: John Cameron\n\n**Written by**: Cynthia Adarkwa", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qqsb3p", "subreddit": "television", "author": "NicholasCajun", "score": 129, "comments": 353, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1769973745, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "653b470d52c8c5ae061668d7fcb7f2509ccbaca1", "source": "reddit", "title": "Im excited for the live action scooby doo series.", "body": "For one this isnt just like another animated franchise getting turned into live action.

Usually, even if you don't watch these kinds of films, you hear about them in some way.

They impress you a couple of times by deducing the location of the killer from his online photographs, but in the end not a single bit of their “sleuthing” helped at all. They didn’t contribute a single thing to his arrest, and if they had never gotten involved, the investigation and capture would have proceeded exactly the same. And the self-congratulatory tone they have had the whole documentary instantly gets a lot less charming when you know they did buggery fuck all.\n\nIn fact, not only did they initially get the wrong man and harass him until he killed himself(!), they only “found” the real culprit because they were so terrible at finding him he just messaged them his own name in the guise of an anonymous tip. Even then, the cops found him from identification papers he left with the body, not because of the group.\n\nAnd the fucking audacity they have to be frustrated at the police for not taking them seriously and tweeting “I told you sos” at them (one gets an entire dramatic recreation of the abuse she tweeted at the cop’s official Twitter account), when none of their information could have prevented the murder and they contributed NOTHING to the investigation or eventual capture. It was the ordinary work of those actual police and Interpol that got him. Meanwhile the murder of the actual victim Jun Lin is a barely-mentioned afterthought to them. The contrast between their reaction to the video of his death vs the genuinely traumatised police detective’s is sickening. You just get such a horrible sense of how they completely trivialised his life cos it was all just a fucking game to them.\n\nAt the end when they’re recalling the killer’s capture, they cheer and hoot like they had fucking anything to do with it. They were of NO value to the police or the victims. All their hours of obsession and they did NOTHING. They did no good for the world. In fact, if they stayed out of it the world would probably be a little bit better. That man they hounded might still be alive, and they would’ve given the killer less of the attention he was desperate for. They only gave him more than he would've gotten otherwise, and got a guy killed.\n\nFor fuck’s sake, they made an entire Facebook group dedicated to the murderer, which they KNEW HE WAS IN, and instead of shutting it down they just kept feeding him the attention like a dedicated audience. He played them and turned them into an attention farm and they’re PROUD of it?? They felt like such clever clogs, but he knew they were rubes who’d keep giving him exactly what he wanted and lavishing attention on him. He knew these pathetic nutcase obsessives were as sick as him, and played on their obsession to feed his own sickness. Just a perfect match of parasites feeding off each other online. They arguably escalated him into the murder, they even mention that briefly, but only to go on about it haunts THEM sometimes. They never seem to question if they should have gotten involved in the first place. They still feel like the plucky little good guys in the end, but you're left with the feeling that there should have been some kind of legal action against them.\n\nAnd in the final line of the documentary, one of these no-life chair-moisteners looks right into the camera and shames the audience for being part of the problem for giving the killer more attention. For watching a whole documentary THEY made about him. I would never have even known his name if they didn’t spend three hours jerking themselves off about how much attention THEY gave him!! They’re literally PROFITING off of him and shaming *everyone else* about it??\n\nWhy do they eat up so much oxygen in this documentary? Why are they the main subjects? They are such a side story compared to the actual professionals. Would it have even been three episodes without them droning on about themselves and their useless pointless busywork so much?\n\nThey thought his arrest was gonna be their big moment, but then they had nothing to do with it, and years later they're still trying to make it *their* moment. These self-important comic book guy dweebs are STILL so nakedly desperate to be recognised despite doing fucking dick. Just pissing around on the internet playing pretend cops and getting NOWHERE. Wanting to feel like heroes for doing NOTHING. Thinking they’re entitled to some kind of pat on the head for all the attention they gave this twat. They just can’t stop giving this guy attention so they can skim some off for themselves.

After this we can get down to the business of making dreams and crushing souls. Should be fun! Before we enter Hollywood Week, however, we have one last batch of auditions. These aren’t anything to bat an eye at either, there are some truly heartbreaking stories tonight and some talent that feels like, dare I say, “Top 10 material.” Who am I, Katy Perry? Let’s take a look at which hopefuls make it through to the next round: Robert Taylor, 27, Donaldsonville, La.“Bruises” by Lewis CapaldiRight out of the gate and Idol has me crying already? Maybe it’s just spiked anxiety from, you know, life, but wow wow wow am I here for Robert Taylor (you may remember him from Team Christina on Season 8 of The Voice, BTW) to make it on this show. Being here is a big deal for him: He only recently came out, and was disowned by everyone except his dad, who wanted him to audition for Idol, but as his true self. His dad has passed in January. So anyway, we’re all crying. THANKFULLY, Robert crushes his audition. The emotion just pours out of his vocals. Grace Leer, 27, Nashville, Tenn.“Crowded Table” by The Highwomen // “Crazy” by Patsy ClineA comeback kid! Grace was a contestant on the long-forgot American Juniors (Idol for kids) when she was 11, but opted for a normal childhood afterward. Now she is pursuing country music in Nashville and guys, she is very good. She has a classic country voice, complete with a little yodel and that cry that’ll give you goosebumps. Throughout her audition the judges cannot stop smiling – they’ve found a good one. Katy asks Grace to sing a “sad country song” just to hear her voice on it (still great). They love the texture of her voice and that she knows exactly the kind of artist she wants to be. Oh, it’s going to be fun to watch Grace move forward. Franklin Boone, 27, Durham, N.C.“Dreams” by Fleetwood MacI love when Luke Bryan gets all giggly during an audition. He does that here with Franklin, a teacher at the School of Rock, and declares this the “Alejandro moment” of the season. And after Franklin performs a cool, stripped down version of “Dreams,” Lionel gushes: He loves that Franklin’s come in with style in his voice, in his look, and in his attitude – Franklin’s already a complete package. Luke calls him a “first note kind of singer,” meaning that he knew everything he needed to from the moment Franklin opened his mouth. Will Hollywood Week ruin this true artist? Only time will tell – how exciting! Roselyn Carter, 26, Watts, Calif.“Mother Bowed” by The Pilgrim Travelers // “So High” by John LegendHere’s another audition in which one judge is completely moved from the get-go. Roselyn explains that she’s here to set an example for people in her town, to show them there is a way out of the gang violence, as well as to hopefully find a way to continue to provide for her family. Her voice is raw and full of emotion, and I’m so glad Katy has her sing something a little more contemporary, because Roselyn sounds even better on the John Legend song. Lionel tells her that her interpretation of both those songs “knocks out” and they can’t wait to help Roselyn hone her skills as she moves forward in this competition. Megan Knight, 21, Williamston, N.J.“When Your Mind’s Made Up” by Glen HansardIt’s a beautiful day in Washington, D.C. and the judges want to go sunning on a boat. Who are we to deny them this? It’s clearly all so that Katy can force Luke and Lionel into a triple “I’m flying, Jack! I’m flying!” situation and I don’t blame her. The audition on that boat isn’t the most exciting: The judges give Megan a lot of constructive criticism – she’s overplaying her guitar and overusing her vibrato – but eventually hand over a golden ticket. They weren’t about to end this segment with a rejection, were they? Gilberto Rivera, 23, Orlando, Fla.“Proud Mary” by Tina TurnerWell, the judges did say they are looking for some unidentifiable “x-factor” right? Gilberto – a very hairy guy in a sequined tank and thigh high red boots – certainly gives this his all, complete with some classic “Proud Mary” choreography. Gilberto is a decent singer – he hits a lot of runs and can handle the Tina Turner-ness of it all. The judges can see this, but want him to strip away all the gimmicks. His voice should be the real show. The gimmick is too much for Lionel to get over, so he’s a hard ‘no’ but both Katy and Luke want to see what happens when Gilberto drops the act…and waxes his chest, I guess? That’s where we are now, as a show. Gilberto and his red boots earn a golden ticket. Aliana Jester, 18, Tampa, Fla.“Who’s Lovin’ You” by The MiraclesOkay, this is a story. When Aliana was 12, her mother, who was raising her alone, joined a “religion” and when Aliana didn’t want to join and eventually started dating a non-religious person, her mother got so angry she basically locked her in her room. It’s awful and Aliana almost didn’t survive. Finally, she was able to contact her father and he got her out of there. He saved her life. It’s wild. But now she’s here on Idol with her cute emotional support dog, making things happen for herself. Aliana has a big ol’ booming voice. The judges want her to infuse more emotion into her performance, but other than that they are in love. She reminds Lionel of a “young Whitney” and what more of a response do you need than that? Jahzan, 18, Kingston, Jamaica“Warrior” by Demi LovatoIdol is really hitting these big stories hard tonight. Jahzan and her mother fled from Jamaica when she was 15 “for safety” reasons, but says she’s not allowed to expand on it any further than that. Now, she and her mother live in their uncle’s salon in New York and busk for money. Her mother is her hypewoman and they’re both putting all of their hopes for a better life into this audition basket. Jahzan has a crazy unique voice – Katy says it’s a mix of Toni Braxton, Cher, and Shakira, if that helps you at all – but it is definitely unpolished and lacks control. The judges, however, see lots of potential and are moved by her story, so they are willing to help coach her, and so hand her a ticket to Hollywood Week. Jordan Moyes, 25, Provo, Utah“I’m On Fire” by Bruce SpringsteenHey, it’s another artist giving Luke Bryan the giggles. More than that, during Jordan’s audition, Luke leans over to Katy and whispers, “I want to sign him now.” Honestly, he should do that! It’s a way easier path than suffering through rounds and rounds of Idol! Luke is enamored with his skills on the guitar, his delivery, and his vocals. It’s a haunting cover of this Bruce classic. Lionel just says that Jordan is “very, very, very good” which doesn’t sound like a lot, but guys, it’s the way he says it. The judges love Jordan. Demi Rae, 26, San Jose, Calif.“Mad At You” by Noah CyrusDemi Rae is legit sunshine and I am thankful! for! her! First of all, she’s rocking a pink sweatshirt, biker shorts, gems on her eyelids, and some serious hair clips. More important, when she was nine, she wrote down that her dream was to be on American Idol, and even though her home life hasn’t been ideal, she is here, making it happen! Okay, wait, actually most important: SHE CAN SING. Luke is especially impressed by her “perfectly done falsetto runs” and when they all hear that she’s never pursued music because she thinks she doesn’t look the part, they pretty much want to throw things at her. But, like, in a good way – in a she is deserving of pursuing her dream kind of way. She’ll get to do just that in Hollywood. Makayla Brownlee, 17, Wellington, Kan.“Travelin’ Soldier” by the Dixie Chicks“Little Kansas snake hunter, you’re going to Hollywood” is a real sentence that was uttered and not just Luke Bryan playing mad libs. Makayla is a country girl through and through, all the way to her “sweet and sincere” country voice. It’s actually shocking to hear such a delicate, haunting voice come out of Makayla’s mouth, but that’s her, folks! Lionel tells her that her “magic trick” is the natural “country yodel cry” she has, and she should definitely keep picking songs that take advantage of that. Luke warns her that the female country artist contingent is strong this year, so she needs to be prepared, but he believes she can get in there and battle with the best of them. Amber Fiedler, 23, Coeur D’Alene, Idaho“Trust In Me” by Etta JamesAMBER. Amber is 38 weeks pregnant, but as she explains to the judges, she is giving the baby up for adoption. She’s had a tough life – her own mother battled with drugs – and isn’t at all ready to be a parent, so she’s found a family who can give this child a better life. She says it all very matter-of-factly and it is very moving and mature. But can we also talk about her singing? The greatest thing about this audition is that is just gets better and better. She has complete control and confidence in her voice, so she doesn’t mind waiting to really open up and knock our faces off. It’s effortless and “timeless,” Luke says. It’s the perfect way to end the audition rounds. Hey friends, you want to know something great? Now we’re all going to Hollywood! The Hollywood Week promos promise more twists and crying than ever before. That’s something to look forward to, right?

Jackson in an eyepatch. Marvel is headed to Disneyland, with the all-new Avengers Campus set to open in Disney California Adventure Park on July 18. The massive Marvel area is the latest addition to Disney’s ever-growing collection of attractions, coming just a year after the debut of its Star Wars-themed Galaxy’s Edge. And just as that space promised a ticket to an immersive galaxy far, far away, Avengers Campus will welcome visiting recruits into a small corner of the sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe. Last week, EW was among a handful of press outlets invited to tour the still-under-construction Avengers Campus and get the scoop on all things super. The opening is still several months away, and it shows: At the moment, hidden behind fences emblazoned with the Stark Industries logo, you’ll find little more than rough building shells, exposed beams, and scaffolding. But as you tromp through the mud, it’s hard not to imagine a Quinjet perched on top of that building, or Spider-Man swinging from that roof just overhead. This is Disney’s attempt to bring the world of Marvel off the screen, out of the comics, and into the real world. Marvel has had a Disneyland presence before, and as of right now, visitors can already meet heroes like Captain Marvel, Captain America, and Black Panther or ride the already-up-and-running Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout! (which replaced the old Tower of Terror several years ago). But Avengers Campus is something far more ambitious. The goal isn’t just to let you say hi to your favorite heroes; it’s to help you work alongside them and write your own comic-book-worthy origin story. Maybe you’ll help Peter Parker stop a swarm of skittering robots. Maybe you’ll go through the rigorous Dora Milaje training program. And maybe you’ll tap into your mystical side and learn some wizardry from Doctor Strange. This isn’t a top-secret, restricted facility like S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ. Avengers Campus is open to all, and they’re actively looking for new recruits (a.k.a. Disneyland visitors) to join their ranks and prove their heroism. Located where the old A Bug’s Land used to be in California Adventure, Avengers Campus is considerably smaller than Galaxy’s Edge, but it still squeezes in tons of Marvel geekery. The entire space is one cohesive area, divided into distinct zones: The Guardians of the Galaxy are already represented with Taneleer Tivan’s cosmic tower and Mission: Breakout, but there’s also the main Avengers building, a mystical outdoor Sanctum, the high-tech Pym Test Kitchen, and the newly established Worldwide Engineering Brigade, a.k.a. WEB. (During our tour, one Disney Imagineer compared it to a college campus, with several distinct fraternities and sororities.) Here, EW breaks down all the different areas and heroic opportunities, as well as what to expect when Avengers Campus officially opens its doors this summer. Meet your heroes (literally) at Avengers Headquarters Avengers Campus isn’t a meticulous recreation of places we’ve already seen on film; instead, it’s something totally new — and kind of old. The story goes that back in the 1940s, Tony Stark’s father Howard erected a Stark Motors factory here in California, and decades later, everyone’s favorite billionaire-playboy-philanthropist has transformed the site into a place for the Avengers to recruit and train young heroes. (Marvel loves a good acronym, so the “Campus” name stands for Centralized Assembly Mobilized to Prepare, Unite, and Safeguard.) The centerpiece is the massive, shiny headquarters, topped by a gleaming Quinjet. It’s similar in design to the HQ we’ve seen in the films, but this is its own, unique building. “That’s part of the reason why we wanted to create Avengers Campus as a brand-new place in the universe because then it doesn’t matter your level of fandom,” explains Jillian Pagan, staff writer for Walt Disney Imagineering. “You’re all coming in at the same level. You all can explore a brand-new place together.” There are embedded Easter eggs for the diehard fans who can name every Infinity Stone, as well as the newbies who don’t know their Iron Men from their Ant-Men. There will be plenty of heroes on hand, too: Visitors will be able to meet and interact with Iron Man, Spider-Man, Black Widow, Black Panther, Okoye and the Dora Milaje, Ant-Man, Wasp, Doctor Strange, Groot, Gamora, Star-Lord, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Thor, and Loki. A few of the heroes even dressed up specially for the occasion: Marvel Studios head of visual development Ryan Meinerding helped design a new, park-exclusive suit for Spider-Man and new Mark 80 armor for Iron Man. And since every superhero needs a villain, Avengers Campus will mark the debut of Taskmaster, the classic comics foe who’ll be joining the MCU in the upcoming Black Widow movie. The masked menace has a photographic memory and the ability to instantly copy his opponents’ fighting styles, and depending on when you visit, you may witness a dramatic showdown between the Avengers and Taskmaster on the roof of HQ. (Many of the stunts and fights were choreographed by the same fight coordinator team who worked on Black Widow.) “That guy has been bedeviling the Avengers for a really long time,” teases Dan Fields, executive creative director for Disney Parks Live Entertainment. “What a great foe to have to outthink and outfight and outmaneuver when he’s making an incursion here in the campus.” Of course, the presence of certain heroes raises the question: How can Iron Man or Black Widow be here, alive and well, when we last saw them, uh, dramatically kick the bucket in Avengers: Endgame? The answer is the same way Marvel’s been explaining continuity shenanigans in the comics for decades: Blame it on the multiverse! Avengers: Endgame hinges on the idea that you can go back in time and create alternate timelines and universes. Who’s to say that there isn’t another timeline where these particular heroes went west to California and opened Avengers Campus? “We diverge from the films in that we do kind of live in our own version of the multiverse,” Pagan explains. “We have some characters who maybe sadly have died and have sacrificed themselves in one part of the multiverse but are alive and well in our part of the multiverse. But we can still be informed and have that shared history with the events of the films.” Save the day with the Worldwide Engineering Brigade, a.k.a. WEB The Avengers aren’t the only heroic organization on Avengers Campus. One of the old brick buildings from Howard Stark’s automotive factory has been repurposed by the Worldwide Engineering Brigade — fittingly shortened to WEB. This exclusive, Stark-bankrolled club aims to unite some of the world’s brightest young minds and encourage them to invent new technologies. It’s here that young geniuses like Shuri and Peter Parker might dream up their next invention. If the main Avengers building is all shiny and chrome, WEB is considerably rougher around the edges. When we toured the site, it was still unfinished, but there were old Stark logos stenciled on the walls, and the brand-new brick was artificially weathered and cracked, as if it had been baking in the California sun for the last 80 years. WEB is also home to the campus’s main new attraction: an all-ages Spider-Man ride. Officially named “WEB Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure,” the ride lets visitors team up with Peter Parker to — you guessed it — sling webs and have an adventure. At first, riders enter the WEB building as if they’re there to attend an open house and learn more about the engineering team. Peter’s there showing off one of WEB’s recent inventions, a group of small, drone-like Spider-Bots — which immediately proceed to go haywire and start wreaking havoc. It’s up to riders to don 3D glasses, pile into small rotating cars called “WEB Slinger vehicles,” and start shooting some webs of their own to help catch the wayward bots. There are no buttons to press or blasters to shoot; every vehicle is equipped with brand-new motion-tracking tech, so all you have to do is extend your arm, the way Spider-Man does. (The Imagineers promise that it’s one of those things that’s hard to describe but will feel totally intuitive in person — so we’ll see.) “We wanted it to feel not like there was a special device that had these powers, but you had these special powers,” explains executive creative director Brent Strong. “Early on, our goal was: How do we make the interface disappear? How do we make the interface as transparent as possible, so it feels like you’re web-slinging, and not that you’re wielding a web-slinger?” When we visited, the Imagineers were coy about who might be voicing WEB Slinger’s version of Spider-Man, but since then, Disneyland’s announced that Tom Holland will be lending his voice to the ride. (He’s not the only MCU actor to make an appearance in the land, either: The Guardians of the Galaxy and the Collector himself, Benicio del Toro, already pop up during Mission: Breakout.) And although Spider-Man is the main hero hanging around WEB, comics fans might notice a few familiar names around the building. After all, a place like WEB would attract some of Marvel’s youngest and brightest engineering minds, so while you’re waiting in line, look for references to brilliant young comic heroes like Doreen Green (better known as Squirrel Girl) or the 9-year-old Lunella Lafayette (a.k.a. Moon Girl). Master the mystic arts in Doctor Strange’s Sanctum Much of Avengers Campus is all about the tech, but there’s also a place for the magical and unexplained. Hidden off the main path is an overgrown Sanctum, presided over by Doctor Strange himself. This is no Bleecker Street; this is an ancient temple imbued with magic, and many, uh, strange things happen here. For the Imagineers tasked with building it, it’s another example of taking an idea from the comics and films and exploring it in a totally different setting. “We’re not trying to rubber stamp something right out of the film,” explains Heidi Rosendahl, principal color and paint artisan. “We’ve kind of created our own Sanctum here, and an open, airy space — very much a contrast to the others that are brick and mortar-type facilities. Everything’s a little bit ethereal, and nature comes into play. It’s going to be a very beautiful transition between day and night.” Taste the future at the Pym Test Kitchen If visitors are looking for sustenance in between missions, they have a few options. Over by the Collector’s fortress, Taneleer Tivan himself has opened a stand called Terran Treats, which will feature all sorts of strange, alien edibles (like neon-colored churro spirals and cream puffs). Far more familiar will be the Shawarma Palace cart, a nod to the post-credits scene in 2012’s original Avengers movie. According to the Imagineers, Tony and friends couldn’t fathom the idea of heading west without access to their favorite post-Battle-of-New-York fast food joint, so they asked the restaurant’s owner to open a secondary location here on campus. But the main restaurant on campus is superhero-owned and operated. At the Pym Test Kitchen and adjacent Pym Tasting Lab, everything on the menu has been sized up or down using Ant-Man and the Wasp’s tech — think gargantuan candy bars or impossibly large meatballs. Even walking into the Test Kitchen is designed to feel a bit like walking into an enormous Quantum Tunnel, with its sleek, scientific design. Overhead, regular-sized pretzels zoom by on a conveyer belt, until they’re zapped with Pym Particles and emerge three times larger. There will also be plenty of beverage options, both alcoholic and otherwise. And in a nod to the oft-forgotten Incredible Hulk movie, the neon-green soda Pingo Doce will be for sale — hopefully, gamma radiation not included. (Read more about the Avengers Campus food and beverage options here.) All of this will be available when Avengers Campus opens its doors in July, but the Imagineers promise that they’re planning long past this summer. (Disney has previously teased a future interactive Avengers ride, set in Black Panther’s Wakanda.) By working with the Marvel Studios development teams, they’ve planted Easter eggs and references for films and Disney+ TV shows that won’t be released for years. “We always have endless ideas, and thankfully, there’s always more movies, there’s always more comic books,” executive creative director Brent Strong says. “We have more references and inspiration than you could ever hope for, so there’s no shortage of ideas. It’s just a matter of time before they all find their way off the page and into the park.” Related content: —All the Avengers Campus food and beverages, from Pingo Doce to shawarma —Disney unveils new Avengers, Spider-Man rides for Marvel park expansions —Disney to follow Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge theme park expansion with Marvel land", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "ew.com", "priority": 72, "ts": 1769973905, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "2fddbe24676b57a3b355dddece3a75c525a44060", "post_id": "http://ew.com/?post_type=recap&p=6631541", "source": "rss", "event_type": "item", "title": "‘American Idol’ recap: The Auditions come to a close with some memorable performances", "body": "Well here’s a small blessing in these troubling times: We’ve reached the end of the American Idol auditions!

Megan Knight, 21, Williamston, N.J.“When Your Mind’s Made Up” by Glen HansardIt’s a beautiful day in Washington, D.C. and the judges want to go sunning on a boat. Who are we to deny them this? It’s clearly all so that Katy can force Luke and Lionel into a triple “I’m flying, Jack! I’m flying!” situation and I don’t blame her. The audition on that boat isn’t the most exciting: The judges give Megan a lot of constructive criticism – she’s overplaying her guitar and overusing her vibrato – but eventually hand over a golden ticket. They weren’t about to end this segment with a rejection, were they? Gilberto Rivera, 23, Orlando, Fla.“Proud Mary” by Tina TurnerWell, the judges did say they are looking for some unidentifiable “x-factor” right? Gilberto – a very hairy guy in a sequined tank and thigh high red boots – certainly gives this his all, complete with some classic “Proud Mary” choreography. Gilberto is a decent singer – he hits a lot of runs and can handle the Tina Turner-ness of it all. The judges can see this, but want him to strip away all the gimmicks. His voice should be the real show. The gimmick is too much for Lionel to get over, so he’s a hard ‘no’ but both Katy and Luke want to see what happens when Gilberto drops the act…and waxes his chest, I guess? That’s where we are now, as a show. Gilberto and his red boots earn a golden ticket. Aliana Jester, 18, Tampa, Fla.“Who’s Lovin’ You” by The MiraclesOkay, this is a story. When Aliana was 12, her mother, who was raising her alone, joined a “religion” and when Aliana didn’t want to join and eventually started dating a non-religious person, her mother got so angry she basically locked her in her room. It’s awful and Aliana almost didn’t survive. Finally, she was able to contact her father and he got her out of there. He saved her life. It’s wild. But now she’s here on Idol with her cute emotional support dog, making things happen for herself. Aliana has a big ol’ booming voice. The judges want her to infuse more emotion into her performance, but other than that they are in love. She reminds Lionel of a “young Whitney” and what more of a response do you need than that? Jahzan, 18, Kingston, Jamaica“Warrior” by Demi LovatoIdol is really hitting these big stories hard tonight. Jahzan and her mother fled from Jamaica when she was 15 “for safety” reasons, but says she’s not allowed to expand on it any further than that. Now, she and her mother live in their uncle’s salon in New York and busk for money. Her mother is her hypewoman and they’re both putting all of their hopes for a better life into this audition basket. Jahzan has a crazy unique voice – Katy says it’s a mix of Toni Braxton, Cher, and Shakira, if that helps you at all – but it is definitely unpolished and lacks control. The judges, however, see lots of potential and are moved by her story, so they are willing to help coach her, and so hand her a ticket to Hollywood Week. Jordan Moyes, 25, Provo, Utah“I’m On Fire” by Bruce SpringsteenHey, it’s another artist giving Luke Bryan the giggles. More than that, during Jordan’s audition, Luke leans over to Katy and whispers, “I want to sign him now.” Honestly, he should do that! It’s a way easier path than suffering through rounds and rounds of Idol! Luke is enamored with his skills on the guitar, his delivery, and his vocals. It’s a haunting cover of this Bruce classic. Lionel just says that Jordan is “very, very, very good” which doesn’t sound like a lot, but guys, it’s the way he says it. The judges love Jordan. Demi Rae, 26, San Jose, Calif.“Mad At You” by Noah CyrusDemi Rae is legit sunshine and I am thankful! for! her! First of all, she’s rocking a pink sweatshirt, biker shorts, gems on her eyelids, and some serious hair clips. More important, when she was nine, she wrote down that her dream was to be on American Idol, and even though her home life hasn’t been ideal, she is here, making it happen! Okay, wait, actually most important: SHE CAN SING. Luke is especially impressed by her “perfectly done falsetto runs” and when they all hear that she’s never pursued music because she thinks she doesn’t look the part, they pretty much want to throw things at her. But, like, in a good way – in a she is deserving of pursuing her dream kind of way. She’ll get to do just that in Hollywood. Makayla Brownlee, 17, Wellington, Kan.“Travelin’ Soldier” by the Dixie Chicks“Little Kansas snake hunter, you’re going to Hollywood” is a real sentence that was uttered and not just Luke Bryan playing mad libs. Makayla is a country girl through and through, all the way to her “sweet and sincere” country voice. It’s actually shocking to hear such a delicate, haunting voice come out of Makayla’s mouth, but that’s her, folks! Lionel tells her that her “magic trick” is the natural “country yodel cry” she has, and she should definitely keep picking songs that take advantage of that. Luke warns her that the female country artist contingent is strong this year, so she needs to be prepared, but he believes she can get in there and battle with the best of them. Amber Fiedler, 23, Coeur D’Alene, Idaho“Trust In Me” by Etta JamesAMBER. Amber is 38 weeks pregnant, but as she explains to the judges, she is giving the baby up for adoption. She’s had a tough life – her own mother battled with drugs – and isn’t at all ready to be a parent, so she’s found a family who can give this child a better life. She says it all very matter-of-factly and it is very moving and mature. But can we also talk about her singing? The greatest thing about this audition is that is just gets better and better. She has complete control and confidence in her voice, so she doesn’t mind waiting to really open up and knock our faces off. It’s effortless and “timeless,” Luke says. It’s the perfect way to end the audition rounds. Hey friends, you want to know something great? Now we’re all going to Hollywood! The Hollywood Week promos promise more twists and crying than ever before. That’s something to look forward to, right?

Jackson in an eyepatch. Marvel is headed to Disneyland, with the all-new Avengers Campus set to open in Disney California Adventure Park on July 18. The massive Marvel area is the latest addition to Disney’s ever-growing collection of attractions, coming just a year after the debut of its Star Wars-themed Galaxy’s Edge. And just as that space promised a ticket to an immersive galaxy far, far away, Avengers Campus will welcome visiting recruits into a small corner of the sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe. Last week, EW was among a handful of press outlets invited to tour the still-under-construction Avengers Campus and get the scoop on all things super. The opening is still several months away, and it shows: At the moment, hidden behind fences emblazoned with the Stark Industries logo, you’ll find little more than rough building shells, exposed beams, and scaffolding. But as you tromp through the mud, it’s hard not to imagine a Quinjet perched on top of that building, or Spider-Man swinging from that roof just overhead. This is Disney’s attempt to bring the world of Marvel off the screen, out of the comics, and into the real world. Marvel has had a Disneyland presence before, and as of right now, visitors can already meet heroes like Captain Marvel, Captain America, and Black Panther or ride the already-up-and-running Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout! (which replaced the old Tower of Terror several years ago). But Avengers Campus is something far more ambitious. The goal isn’t just to let you say hi to your favorite heroes; it’s to help you work alongside them and write your own comic-book-worthy origin story. Maybe you’ll help Peter Parker stop a swarm of skittering robots. Maybe you’ll go through the rigorous Dora Milaje training program. And maybe you’ll tap into your mystical side and learn some wizardry from Doctor Strange. This isn’t a top-secret, restricted facility like S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ. Avengers Campus is open to all, and they’re actively looking for new recruits (a.k.a. Disneyland visitors) to join their ranks and prove their heroism. Located where the old A Bug’s Land used to be in California Adventure, Avengers Campus is considerably smaller than Galaxy’s Edge, but it still squeezes in tons of Marvel geekery. The entire space is one cohesive area, divided into distinct zones: The Guardians of the Galaxy are already represented with Taneleer Tivan’s cosmic tower and Mission: Breakout, but there’s also the main Avengers building, a mystical outdoor Sanctum, the high-tech Pym Test Kitchen, and the newly established Worldwide Engineering Brigade, a.k.a. WEB. (During our tour, one Disney Imagineer compared it to a college campus, with several distinct fraternities and sororities.) Here, EW breaks down all the different areas and heroic opportunities, as well as what to expect when Avengers Campus officially opens its doors this summer. Meet your heroes (literally) at Avengers Headquarters Avengers Campus isn’t a meticulous recreation of places we’ve already seen on film; instead, it’s something totally new — and kind of old. The story goes that back in the 1940s, Tony Stark’s father Howard erected a Stark Motors factory here in California, and decades later, everyone’s favorite billionaire-playboy-philanthropist has transformed the site into a place for the Avengers to recruit and train young heroes. (Marvel loves a good acronym, so the “Campus” name stands for Centralized Assembly Mobilized to Prepare, Unite, and Safeguard.) The centerpiece is the massive, shiny headquarters, topped by a gleaming Quinjet. It’s similar in design to the HQ we’ve seen in the films, but this is its own, unique building. “That’s part of the reason why we wanted to create Avengers Campus as a brand-new place in the universe because then it doesn’t matter your level of fandom,” explains Jillian Pagan, staff writer for Walt Disney Imagineering. “You’re all coming in at the same level. You all can explore a brand-new place together.” There are embedded Easter eggs for the diehard fans who can name every Infinity Stone, as well as the newbies who don’t know their Iron Men from their Ant-Men. There will be plenty of heroes on hand, too: Visitors will be able to meet and interact with Iron Man, Spider-Man, Black Widow, Black Panther, Okoye and the Dora Milaje, Ant-Man, Wasp, Doctor Strange, Groot, Gamora, Star-Lord, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Thor, and Loki. A few of the heroes even dressed up specially for the occasion: Marvel Studios head of visual development Ryan Meinerding helped design a new, park-exclusive suit for Spider-Man and new Mark 80 armor for Iron Man. And since every superhero needs a villain, Avengers Campus will mark the debut of Taskmaster, the classic comics foe who’ll be joining the MCU in the upcoming Black Widow movie. The masked menace has a photographic memory and the ability to instantly copy his opponents’ fighting styles, and depending on when you visit, you may witness a dramatic showdown between the Avengers and Taskmaster on the roof of HQ. (Many of the stunts and fights were choreographed by the same fight coordinator team who worked on Black Widow.) “That guy has been bedeviling the Avengers for a really long time,” teases Dan Fields, executive creative director for Disney Parks Live Entertainment. “What a great foe to have to outthink and outfight and outmaneuver when he’s making an incursion here in the campus.” Of course, the presence of certain heroes raises the question: How can Iron Man or Black Widow be here, alive and well, when we last saw them, uh, dramatically kick the bucket in Avengers: Endgame? The answer is the same way Marvel’s been explaining continuity shenanigans in the comics for decades: Blame it on the multiverse! Avengers: Endgame hinges on the idea that you can go back in time and create alternate timelines and universes. Who’s to say that there isn’t another timeline where these particular heroes went west to California and opened Avengers Campus? “We diverge from the films in that we do kind of live in our own version of the multiverse,” Pagan explains. “We have some characters who maybe sadly have died and have sacrificed themselves in one part of the multiverse but are alive and well in our part of the multiverse. But we can still be informed and have that shared history with the events of the films.” Save the day with the Worldwide Engineering Brigade, a.k.a. WEB The Avengers aren’t the only heroic organization on Avengers Campus. One of the old brick buildings from Howard Stark’s automotive factory has been repurposed by the Worldwide Engineering Brigade — fittingly shortened to WEB. This exclusive, Stark-bankrolled club aims to unite some of the world’s brightest young minds and encourage them to invent new technologies. It’s here that young geniuses like Shuri and Peter Parker might dream up their next invention. If the main Avengers building is all shiny and chrome, WEB is considerably rougher around the edges. When we toured the site, it was still unfinished, but there were old Stark logos stenciled on the walls, and the brand-new brick was artificially weathered and cracked, as if it had been baking in the California sun for the last 80 years. WEB is also home to the campus’s main new attraction: an all-ages Spider-Man ride. Officially named “WEB Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure,” the ride lets visitors team up with Peter Parker to — you guessed it — sling webs and have an adventure. At first, riders enter the WEB building as if they’re there to attend an open house and learn more about the engineering team. Peter’s there showing off one of WEB’s recent inventions, a group of small, drone-like Spider-Bots — which immediately proceed to go haywire and start wreaking havoc. It’s up to riders to don 3D glasses, pile into small rotating cars called “WEB Slinger vehicles,” and start shooting some webs of their own to help catch the wayward bots. There are no buttons to press or blasters to shoot; every vehicle is equipped with brand-new motion-tracking tech, so all you have to do is extend your arm, the way Spider-Man does. (The Imagineers promise that it’s one of those things that’s hard to describe but will feel totally intuitive in person — so we’ll see.) “We wanted it to feel not like there was a special device that had these powers, but you had these special powers,” explains executive creative director Brent Strong. “Early on, our goal was: How do we make the interface disappear? How do we make the interface as transparent as possible, so it feels like you’re web-slinging, and not that you’re wielding a web-slinger?” When we visited, the Imagineers were coy about who might be voicing WEB Slinger’s version of Spider-Man, but since then, Disneyland’s announced that Tom Holland will be lending his voice to the ride. (He’s not the only MCU actor to make an appearance in the land, either: The Guardians of the Galaxy and the Collector himself, Benicio del Toro, already pop up during Mission: Breakout.) And although Spider-Man is the main hero hanging around WEB, comics fans might notice a few familiar names around the building. After all, a place like WEB would attract some of Marvel’s youngest and brightest engineering minds, so while you’re waiting in line, look for references to brilliant young comic heroes like Doreen Green (better known as Squirrel Girl) or the 9-year-old Lunella Lafayette (a.k.a. Moon Girl). Master the mystic arts in Doctor Strange’s Sanctum Much of Avengers Campus is all about the tech, but there’s also a place for the magical and unexplained. Hidden off the main path is an overgrown Sanctum, presided over by Doctor Strange himself. This is no Bleecker Street; this is an ancient temple imbued with magic, and many, uh, strange things happen here. For the Imagineers tasked with building it, it’s another example of taking an idea from the comics and films and exploring it in a totally different setting. “We’re not trying to rubber stamp something right out of the film,” explains Heidi Rosendahl, principal color and paint artisan. “We’ve kind of created our own Sanctum here, and an open, airy space — very much a contrast to the others that are brick and mortar-type facilities. Everything’s a little bit ethereal, and nature comes into play. It’s going to be a very beautiful transition between day and night.” Taste the future at the Pym Test Kitchen If visitors are looking for sustenance in between missions, they have a few options. Over by the Collector’s fortress, Taneleer Tivan himself has opened a stand called Terran Treats, which will feature all sorts of strange, alien edibles (like neon-colored churro spirals and cream puffs). Far more familiar will be the Shawarma Palace cart, a nod to the post-credits scene in 2012’s original Avengers movie. According to the Imagineers, Tony and friends couldn’t fathom the idea of heading west without access to their favorite post-Battle-of-New-York fast food joint, so they asked the restaurant’s owner to open a secondary location here on campus. But the main restaurant on campus is superhero-owned and operated. At the Pym Test Kitchen and adjacent Pym Tasting Lab, everything on the menu has been sized up or down using Ant-Man and the Wasp’s tech — think gargantuan candy bars or impossibly large meatballs. Even walking into the Test Kitchen is designed to feel a bit like walking into an enormous Quantum Tunnel, with its sleek, scientific design. Overhead, regular-sized pretzels zoom by on a conveyer belt, until they’re zapped with Pym Particles and emerge three times larger. There will also be plenty of beverage options, both alcoholic and otherwise. And in a nod to the oft-forgotten Incredible Hulk movie, the neon-green soda Pingo Doce will be for sale — hopefully, gamma radiation not included. (Read more about the Avengers Campus food and beverage options here.) All of this will be available when Avengers Campus opens its doors in July, but the Imagineers promise that they’re planning long past this summer. (Disney has previously teased a future interactive Avengers ride, set in Black Panther’s Wakanda.) By working with the Marvel Studios development teams, they’ve planted Easter eggs and references for films and Disney+ TV shows that won’t be released for years. “We always have endless ideas, and thankfully, there’s always more movies, there’s always more comic books,” executive creative director Brent Strong says. “We have more references and inspiration than you could ever hope for, so there’s no shortage of ideas. It’s just a matter of time before they all find their way off the page and into the park.” Related content: —All the Avengers Campus food and beverages, from Pingo Doce to shawarma —Disney unveils new Avengers, Spider-Man rides for Marvel park expansions —Disney to follow Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge theme park expansion with Marvel land", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "ew.com", "priority": 72, "ts": 1769973905, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "1619826df28eee432010b66d7de6dae2c795d109", "post_id": "http://ew.com/?post_type=recap&p=6631424", "source": "rss", "event_type": "item", "title": "‘NCIS’ recap: Welcome to the dollhouse", "body": "Who’s up for a history lesson, a twisty mystery, and a totally boss Bishop leg-sweep? If so, you’ve come to the right place this week. It’s spring cleaning time at NCIS, and Bishop is going all out. Bags and bags of clothes, mementos, accessories, all of it bound for a donation to the VA and all of it raising the eyebrows of her co-workers, who worry that she’s purging her whole life. Delilah, meanwhile, has put together a donation box that includes McGee’s favorite T-shirt, vintage Atari joystick, and ’80s action figure, which feels a little like the step before she hands him actual divorce papers. Worse, Gibbs swoops in and claims the shirt as a new shop rag, while Palmer manages to swipe the rest of McGee’s stuff for Kasie, who’s got her eye on the joystick. But charity donations aren’t driving the case of the week. That would be the murder of Petty Officer Third Class Noah O’Donnell, whose body was dumped in the road with execution-style gunshot wounds in his chest and head. Noah was an intelligence specialist at Quantico who taught self-defense in his spare time and lived with his sister Claire in the small town of Fillmore. The first person to attract NCIS attention is Det. John Fischer, who investigated the unsolved murder of Noah and Claire’s parents 10 years ago. He’s poking around Noah’s murder but trying to keep it quiet so the media attention doesn’t explode like it did during the popular The Fault in Fillmore podcast about the O’Donnell murders, which turned the town into a three-ring circus for weirdos. He’s overall cagey and hostile with NCIS and claims not to know where Claire’s hiding. But Fischer might be on to something. Like his parents, Noah was shot at close range execution-style, and like his parents, the bullets were removed from his body with long tweezers. Also, when the police found Noah and Claire the night of their parents’ murders, they were wandering in the road, which is exactly where Noah’s body was found. So do we have a copycat, or is the original killer back? The team next questions Paul Johansson, a tank of a man who taught self-defense at the same facility as Noah. He says Noah was well-liked, while Claire’s nothing but trouble: unable to hold a job and prone to wandering at night like a zombie. Noah moved in to keep an eye on her, but she dragged him down too. Next stop: the old O’Donnell house, where the murders happened a decade ago. It’s a condemned wreck, and Gibbs and Bishop are keenly aware of all the neighborhood eyes on them as they investigate. (Rule 35: Always watch the watchers!) In the backyard, they find a storage shed with a padlock that has Claire’s initials on it. Once they gain entry, they find a macabre workroom with crime scene photos everywhere and dollhouses that painstakingly recreate the murder scenes depicted. And yes, one of the dollhouses showcases Claire’s own parents’ murder. Back at NCIS, Ducky recognizes them as modern-day nutshells in the style of Frances Glessner Lee, who created a series of crime scene miniatures in the 1940s. Called the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death, they were intricate and beautifully rendered dollhouses that were used to train homicide detectives and forensics students to analyze crime scenes when the field was still in its infancy. Three of the dollhouses feature solved crimes, with the O’Donnell murder the only unsolved one. Sloane wonders aloud if Claire’s a hobbyist coping with trauma through true crime. Then again, NCIS found long-handled tweezers with Noah’s blood on them in Claire’s desk, so she may also have found a different coping mechanism. A talk with the head of the Historical Society Miniature Enthusiast Group reveals that Claire’s the most recent HSMEG member, and she’s fixated on her parents’ murder in part out of fear that the killer isn’t done with her family. Notoriety isn’t done with the family either; when news of Noah’s death hits the news, the O’Donnell house is swarmed by podcast fans there for Claire. The loudest women in the crowd are a goth and a cat sweatshirt aficionado, who remind NCIS that Claire always returns to the scene of the crime in her nocturnal wanderings. Ah, but tonight she has a new crime scene to visit. Gibbs heads straight to the stretch of road where Noah’s body was found, and there’s Claire, brandishing Noah’s gun for protection. Gibbs gently suggests that her parents would want her to come into the light, and he escorts her to NCIS for questioning. Vance, seeing a traumatized young woman who lost her parents, scampers off to call his kids. Claire starts things off by asking Gibbs, “Has anyone you love ever been killed?” (Oh dear. So many.) Then she says Noah was helping her solve their parents’ murders and must’ve uncovered something. “He’s dead because of me.” In fact, Noah did have an almost illegible evidence custody document on his body, and Claire has an alibi thanks to the #WheresClaire hashtag with photos of sightings that night placing her nowhere near Noah’s body. Time for a new suspect. At this point, Fischer storms NCIS, demanding to know why Claire’s being held. He tells Gibbs that he’ll never forget coming across the O’Donnell kids the night of the murders, and he spits out that the only reason he didn’t solve the case years ago was because a bureaucrat like Gibbs wouldn’t spare the budget to exhume the body of the transient man Fischer liked for the crime to compare it to a DNA sample. Gibbs takes another run at getting answers from Claire, which he does by proving his investigative chops on her nutshells: a murder/suicide stemming from a financial dispute. An acquaintance kidnapping. Robbery/arson/murder. That last one stops Claire short. It’s the nutshell that Noah built, although it was officially ruled an electrical fire thanks to bad wiring, not arson. “We’ve been looking into the wrong case,” Gibbs realizes. This new case involves the recently widowed Louise Fitzgerald, who was worth millions and found dead in her burned home. If Noah started to suspect murder, that points in a whole different direction. Specifically, it points toward the self-defense classes, which Louise attended with Noah… and his buddy Paul, whose day job is an electrician. Paul realizes the jig is up and tries to run, charging directly at Bishop. He’s easily twice her size and clearly intends to bowl her over and escape, but she drops and sweeps her leg in his path, taking him down. It’s … it’s impressive. In short order, we learn that Paul had gambling debts, so he stole from Louise, killed her, and set the fire to cover it up. When Noah asked for his input on how someone might stage an electrical fire, Paul killed him and tried to frame Claire. The case solved, Sloane urges Claire to make an appointment to start therapy with Grace Confalone, while Kasie tries to recruit Claire to join her in forensics. Claire declines but mentions that someone recently offered her $10,000 to build their daughter a dollhouse. OOOH, DO THAT, CLAIRE! Also, Ducky called in a favor and got an exhumation order for the suspect in the O’Donnell parents’ murder, so Claire heads off to meet with Fischer, hopeful that he can deliver the same justice she helped provide for Noah. In the final minutes of the episode, Bishop slides onto the Elevator of Schemes and Secrets with Gibbs and rather defensively tells him that she’s giving away all her things because she’s evolved and isn’t the same person that she was when she started. Gibbs doesn’t disagree, but he does remind her, “You can’t erase it all,” handing her the OSU Pistol Pete hat he plucked from her donation pile. Then Bishop gets a text from Odette that reads, “Tomorrow 6 a.m.” Who’s ready for secret agent Bishop, y’all? Stray shots Very cool episode tonight! While the podcast fandom could’ve been fleshed out into something bigger and more fun, the mystery itself and Claire’s sad story were well done, and the ambiguous ending leaves us with a little frisson of uncertainty. Will Claire ever find a resolution to her parents’ murders? Torres quote of the week: “Are you trying to tell me how to Kondo?” Hey, CBS, I’d watch a 24-episode series of people solving crimes based on nutshell dollhouses. Likewise, I would watch many seasons of Claire building gorgeous dollhouses and solving crimes. Either or both would be fabulous. Hit me up. Speaking of the nutshell dollhouses: Frances Glessner Lee is real and did, in fact, utilize a traditionally feminine craft to excel in the male-dominated world of law enforcement in the 1940s. If you want to learn more, this CBS News Sunday Morning piece is an excellent overview of her work. I hope you’re as blown away by her talent as I am!", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "ew.com", "priority": 72, "ts": 1769974086, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "5ff0e940e56c5d615106b3092ee7604417ce658a", "post_id": "http://ew.com/?p=6631329", "source": "rss", "event_type": "item", "title": "Scarlett Johansson breaks down a decade of Black Widow’s best scenes", "body": "It’s been 10 years since we first met Scarlett Johansson’s Natasha Romanoff, handily taking down Happy Hogan in Tony Stark’s boxing ring. Over the last decade, she’s evolved from morally conflicted superspy to avenging hero and, ultimately, the sacrificial savior of the universe. With Nat finally stepping into the spotlight for her own solo film, EW asked Johansson to look back on a key scene from every Black Widow appearance. Iron Man 2 (2010)The superspy made her MCU debut with a brutal hallway fight, knocking down bad guys and setting up her next decade on screen. “A lot of the moves are really spider-like, they’re balletic, and they pay homage to Natasha’s past,” Johansson explains. “I’m still doing a lot of those moves today, just a little bit more creaky.” Time comes for us all, even trained assassins. The Avengers (2012)One of Natasha’s key moments comes early in The Avengers, as she and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) verbally spar and try to wheedle information out of each other. It’s one of the audience’s first glimpses into Natasha’s past, and Johansson says the scene owes its back-and-forth energy to Avengers writer-director Joss Whedon. “It’s got this great dramatic intensity, and then it’s just super playful,” she adds. Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)Johansson and Captain America star Chris Evans first worked together a decade earlier in 2004’s The Perfect Score, and the actress says it’s their off-screen friendship that made scenes like this — where Steve and Nat — so effortless. “It’s really a result of 10 years of knowing somebody and being able to have a kind of intimacy with them that I think you get from just spending a lot of time with somebody and knowing their soft underbelly,” she says. Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)As a general rule, most spies dedicate their careers to putting up walls, but this Age of Ultron moment with Mark Ruffalo‘s Bruce Banner is a rare moment of vulnerability for Nat. As for the scene itself — in which Natasha opens up about her forced sterilization and inability to have children — filming it required a bit of movie magic. “ ironic because I was also really pregnant at the time,” Johansson adds with a laugh. Captain America: Civil War (2016)Until Infinity War united its heroes for the fight against Thanos, 2016’s Civil War held the record for the most Avengers in one place, thanks to its climactic airport runway battle. On the days Johansson shot the scene in Atlanta, the temperature of the tarmac soared above 100 degrees — but the result, she says, was worth it. “I remember both sides running at each other, full speed charging at each other, and you knew that the universe would be forever changed after that.” Avengers: Infinity War (2018)The final Wakanda battle in Infinity War sees Natasha teaming up with Elizabeth Olsen‘s Scarlet Witch and Danai Gurira‘s Okoye to take down Proxima Midnight (Carrie Coon). “We were just this random other unit that was fighting in a ditch for like weeks,” Johansson says with a laugh. “When Lizzie came along, we were like, ‘And where have you been! You get to do the awesome hero pose, and we’ve been eating dirt for three weeks!'” Avengers: Endgame (2019)Nat’s final hero moment, where she sacrifices herself for the Soul Stone, was originally filmed as a chase scene with an “army of Dementor-type creatures,” Johansson reveals. “I was thinking, ‘Parents will never forgive us for how these creatures look.'” But the sequence felt too busy in an already action-packed film, so she and Jeremy Renner later reshot it as a quieter, more emotional confrontation. “We wanted to leave with the weight of that loss and the shock of it,” Johansson says. Black Widow (2020)Audiences at 2019’s San Diego Comic-Con were treated to an early cut of this scene from the solo Black Widow movie, where Nat reunites with her “sister,” Florence Pugh‘s Yelena Belova — and they proceed to beat the crap out of each other. (It was also one of the first scenes Pugh and Johansson shot together, and it forced them to get up close and personal fast.) “It’s like when you see prize fighters who have come together to have a second go at it, and you know that there’s all that built-up tension in a good kind of way,” Johansson explains. BONUS SCENE: The Avengers (2012)One of Johansson’s personal highlights is the moment the Avengers, well, assembled, for the now-iconic 360-degree shot during the Battle of New York. “I remember all of us assembling in that circle and looking around,” she explains. “All of us had a moment where we were like, ‘Oh. This is going to work.’” To read more on Black Widow, pick up the new issue of Entertainment Weekly beginning on Tuesday, March 17, or buy it here now.

If so, you’ve come to the right place this week. It’s spring cleaning time at NCIS, and Bishop is going all out. Bags and bags of clothes, mementos, accessories, all of it bound for a donation to the VA and all of it raising the eyebrows of her co-workers, who worry that she’s purging her whole life. Delilah, meanwhile, has put together a donation box that includes McGee’s favorite T-shirt, vintage Atari joystick, and ’80s action figure, which feels a little like the step before she hands him actual divorce papers. Worse, Gibbs swoops in and claims the shirt as a new shop rag, while Palmer manages to swipe the rest of McGee’s stuff for Kasie, who’s got her eye on the joystick. But charity donations aren’t driving the case of the week. That would be the murder of Petty Officer Third Class Noah O’Donnell, whose body was dumped in the road with execution-style gunshot wounds in his chest and head. Noah was an intelligence specialist at Quantico who taught self-defense in his spare time and lived with his sister Claire in the small town of Fillmore. The first person to attract NCIS attention is Det. John Fischer, who investigated the unsolved murder of Noah and Claire’s parents 10 years ago. He’s poking around Noah’s murder but trying to keep it quiet so the media attention doesn’t explode like it did during the popular The Fault in Fillmore podcast about the O’Donnell murders, which turned the town into a three-ring circus for weirdos. He’s overall cagey and hostile with NCIS and claims not to know where Claire’s hiding. But Fischer might be on to something. Like his parents, Noah was shot at close range execution-style, and like his parents, the bullets were removed from his body with long tweezers. Also, when the police found Noah and Claire the night of their parents’ murders, they were wandering in the road, which is exactly where Noah’s body was found. So do we have a copycat, or is the original killer back? The team next questions Paul Johansson, a tank of a man who taught self-defense at the same facility as Noah. He says Noah was well-liked, while Claire’s nothing but trouble: unable to hold a job and prone to wandering at night like a zombie. Noah moved in to keep an eye on her, but she dragged him down too. Next stop: the old O’Donnell house, where the murders happened a decade ago. It’s a condemned wreck, and Gibbs and Bishop are keenly aware of all the neighborhood eyes on them as they investigate. (Rule 35: Always watch the watchers!) In the backyard, they find a storage shed with a padlock that has Claire’s initials on it. Once they gain entry, they find a macabre workroom with crime scene photos everywhere and dollhouses that painstakingly recreate the murder scenes depicted. And yes, one of the dollhouses showcases Claire’s own parents’ murder. Back at NCIS, Ducky recognizes them as modern-day nutshells in the style of Frances Glessner Lee, who created a series of crime scene miniatures in the 1940s. Called the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death, they were intricate and beautifully rendered dollhouses that were used to train homicide detectives and forensics students to analyze crime scenes when the field was still in its infancy. Three of the dollhouses feature solved crimes, with the O’Donnell murder the only unsolved one. Sloane wonders aloud if Claire’s a hobbyist coping with trauma through true crime. Then again, NCIS found long-handled tweezers with Noah’s blood on them in Claire’s desk, so she may also have found a different coping mechanism. A talk with the head of the Historical Society Miniature Enthusiast Group reveals that Claire’s the most recent HSMEG member, and she’s fixated on her parents’ murder in part out of fear that the killer isn’t done with her family. Notoriety isn’t done with the family either; when news of Noah’s death hits the news, the O’Donnell house is swarmed by podcast fans there for Claire. The loudest women in the crowd are a goth and a cat sweatshirt aficionado, who remind NCIS that Claire always returns to the scene of the crime in her nocturnal wanderings. Ah, but tonight she has a new crime scene to visit. Gibbs heads straight to the stretch of road where Noah’s body was found, and there’s Claire, brandishing Noah’s gun for protection. Gibbs gently suggests that her parents would want her to come into the light, and he escorts her to NCIS for questioning. Vance, seeing a traumatized young woman who lost her parents, scampers off to call his kids. Claire starts things off by asking Gibbs, “Has anyone you love ever been killed?” (Oh dear. So many.) Then she says Noah was helping her solve their parents’ murders and must’ve uncovered something. “He’s dead because of me.” In fact, Noah did have an almost illegible evidence custody document on his body, and Claire has an alibi thanks to the #WheresClaire hashtag with photos of sightings that night placing her nowhere near Noah’s body. Time for a new suspect. At this point, Fischer storms NCIS, demanding to know why Claire’s being held. He tells Gibbs that he’ll never forget coming across the O’Donnell kids the night of the murders, and he spits out that the only reason he didn’t solve the case years ago was because a bureaucrat like Gibbs wouldn’t spare the budget to exhume the body of the transient man Fischer liked for the crime to compare it to a DNA sample. Gibbs takes another run at getting answers from Claire, which he does by proving his investigative chops on her nutshells: a murder/suicide stemming from a financial dispute. An acquaintance kidnapping. Robbery/arson/murder. That last one stops Claire short. It’s the nutshell that Noah built, although it was officially ruled an electrical fire thanks to bad wiring, not arson. “We’ve been looking into the wrong case,” Gibbs realizes. This new case involves the recently widowed Louise Fitzgerald, who was worth millions and found dead in her burned home. If Noah started to suspect murder, that points in a whole different direction. Specifically, it points toward the self-defense classes, which Louise attended with Noah… and his buddy Paul, whose day job is an electrician. Paul realizes the jig is up and tries to run, charging directly at Bishop. He’s easily twice her size and clearly intends to bowl her over and escape, but she drops and sweeps her leg in his path, taking him down. It’s … it’s impressive. In short order, we learn that Paul had gambling debts, so he stole from Louise, killed her, and set the fire to cover it up. When Noah asked for his input on how someone might stage an electrical fire, Paul killed him and tried to frame Claire. The case solved, Sloane urges Claire to make an appointment to start therapy with Grace Confalone, while Kasie tries to recruit Claire to join her in forensics. Claire declines but mentions that someone recently offered her $10,000 to build their daughter a dollhouse. OOOH, DO THAT, CLAIRE! Also, Ducky called in a favor and got an exhumation order for the suspect in the O’Donnell parents’ murder, so Claire heads off to meet with Fischer, hopeful that he can deliver the same justice she helped provide for Noah. In the final minutes of the episode, Bishop slides onto the Elevator of Schemes and Secrets with Gibbs and rather defensively tells him that she’s giving away all her things because she’s evolved and isn’t the same person that she was when she started. Gibbs doesn’t disagree, but he does remind her, “You can’t erase it all,” handing her the OSU Pistol Pete hat he plucked from her donation pile. Then Bishop gets a text from Odette that reads, “Tomorrow 6 a.m.” Who’s ready for secret agent Bishop, y’all? Stray shots Very cool episode tonight! While the podcast fandom could’ve been fleshed out into something bigger and more fun, the mystery itself and Claire’s sad story were well done, and the ambiguous ending leaves us with a little frisson of uncertainty. Will Claire ever find a resolution to her parents’ murders? Torres quote of the week: “Are you trying to tell me how to Kondo?” Hey, CBS, I’d watch a 24-episode series of people solving crimes based on nutshell dollhouses. Likewise, I would watch many seasons of Claire building gorgeous dollhouses and solving crimes. Either or both would be fabulous. Hit me up. Speaking of the nutshell dollhouses: Frances Glessner Lee is real and did, in fact, utilize a traditionally feminine craft to excel in the male-dominated world of law enforcement in the 1940s. If you want to learn more, this CBS News Sunday Morning piece is an excellent overview of her work.

Over the last decade, she’s evolved from morally conflicted superspy to avenging hero and, ultimately, the sacrificial savior of the universe. With Nat finally stepping into the spotlight for her own solo film, EW asked Johansson to look back on a key scene from every Black Widow appearance. Iron Man 2 (2010)The superspy made her MCU debut with a brutal hallway fight, knocking down bad guys and setting up her next decade on screen. “A lot of the moves are really spider-like, they’re balletic, and they pay homage to Natasha’s past,” Johansson explains. “I’m still doing a lot of those moves today, just a little bit more creaky.” Time comes for us all, even trained assassins. The Avengers (2012)One of Natasha’s key moments comes early in The Avengers, as she and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) verbally spar and try to wheedle information out of each other. It’s one of the audience’s first glimpses into Natasha’s past, and Johansson says the scene owes its back-and-forth energy to Avengers writer-director Joss Whedon. “It’s got this great dramatic intensity, and then it’s just super playful,” she adds. Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)Johansson and Captain America star Chris Evans first worked together a decade earlier in 2004’s The Perfect Score, and the actress says it’s their off-screen friendship that made scenes like this — where Steve and Nat — so effortless. “It’s really a result of 10 years of knowing somebody and being able to have a kind of intimacy with them that I think you get from just spending a lot of time with somebody and knowing their soft underbelly,” she says. Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)As a general rule, most spies dedicate their careers to putting up walls, but this Age of Ultron moment with Mark Ruffalo‘s Bruce Banner is a rare moment of vulnerability for Nat. As for the scene itself — in which Natasha opens up about her forced sterilization and inability to have children — filming it required a bit of movie magic. “ ironic because I was also really pregnant at the time,” Johansson adds with a laugh. Captain America: Civil War (2016)Until Infinity War united its heroes for the fight against Thanos, 2016’s Civil War held the record for the most Avengers in one place, thanks to its climactic airport runway battle. On the days Johansson shot the scene in Atlanta, the temperature of the tarmac soared above 100 degrees — but the result, she says, was worth it. “I remember both sides running at each other, full speed charging at each other, and you knew that the universe would be forever changed after that.” Avengers: Infinity War (2018)The final Wakanda battle in Infinity War sees Natasha teaming up with Elizabeth Olsen‘s Scarlet Witch and Danai Gurira‘s Okoye to take down Proxima Midnight (Carrie Coon). “We were just this random other unit that was fighting in a ditch for like weeks,” Johansson says with a laugh. “When Lizzie came along, we were like, ‘And where have you been! You get to do the awesome hero pose, and we’ve been eating dirt for three weeks!'” Avengers: Endgame (2019)Nat’s final hero moment, where she sacrifices herself for the Soul Stone, was originally filmed as a chase scene with an “army of Dementor-type creatures,” Johansson reveals. “I was thinking, ‘Parents will never forgive us for how these creatures look.'” But the sequence felt too busy in an already action-packed film, so she and Jeremy Renner later reshot it as a quieter, more emotional confrontation. “We wanted to leave with the weight of that loss and the shock of it,” Johansson says. Black Widow (2020)Audiences at 2019’s San Diego Comic-Con were treated to an early cut of this scene from the solo Black Widow movie, where Nat reunites with her “sister,” Florence Pugh‘s Yelena Belova — and they proceed to beat the crap out of each other.

Hair drawn back in a tidy braid, she barely glances down at Natasha Romanoff’s familiar black catsuit as she buckles every buckle and zips every zipper with rhythmic efficiency. Squeezed into a closet-size armory on a Manhattan Beach soundstage, Johansson’s assassin-turned-Avenger is surrounded by all the guns, knives, and glossy wigs a superspy could ever need. She moves like she’s been doing this for a decade — because she has. But this is something new: There’s no Captain America or Hawkeye to assist her, no S.H.I.E.L.D. backup waiting out of sight. This is Black Widow’s long-awaited solo movie, set in the turmoil between the all-star superhero team’s breakup in 2016’s Captain America: Civil War and their reunion in 2018’s Avengers: Infinity War. The mission she’s prepping for is personal, as the former Russian agent is going up against opponents from her past. When a fellow Widow, Rachel Weisz’s Melina, wonders how they’ll tackle one particularly formidable foe, Natasha replies, “Just get me close to him.” It’s not an arrogant quip or a self-congratulatory boast, just a matter-of-fact threat from a spy who is very, very good at her job. Then, just as Johansson pulls on her last glove with a satisfying snap…darkness. The studio has lost power; in the dark, someone calls out for flashlights. After a quick investigation, the production crew discovers the blackout is not the work of a diabolical supervillain but a blown transformer nearby. Natasha’s mission will have to wait a little while longer — but that’s all right. Black Widow knows how to wait. When Johansson made her debut as Black Widow in 2010’s Iron Man 2, the then-nascent Marvel Cinematic Universe was more like a small galaxy. Today, it stands as the most profitable film franchise of all time, a sprawling, 20-plus-film juggernaut that’s demolished box office records and turned obscure comic characters into marquee names. Among them is Romanoff, the scarlet-haired superspy without superpowers. Johansson’s portrayal became an immediate fan favorite, thanks to her sarcasm and general penchant for ass-kicking, plus her dramatic evolution — she goes from playing Tony Stark’s undercover personal assistant to Avengers founding member to savior of the universe. Now, after 10 years and seven movies, this spider is finally playing solitaire. Cate Shortland directs the Black Widow stand-alone film (out May 1), a prequel that follows Nat before — spoiler alert! — she sacrificed herself to thwart Thanos in last year’s Avengers: Endgame. The Natasha we’ve known has usually preferred to look ahead instead of behind: First trained to be a killer as a young girl in the secret Soviet Red Room program, she worked as an assassin and KGB agent on some less-than-heroic missions. She’s since devoted her life to more virtuous pursuits, whether that’s foiling alien invasions (several times) or teaching Hulk self-care. Now she’s forced to reexamine her history — and past trauma — when she’s drawn into a Red Room-related conspiracy. “I thought it was interesting to explore this part of her life before she rejoins the Avengers, before she makes that ultimate sacrifice,” Johansson, 35, explains. “How does she become this full person from all these broken pieces?” Johansson — a recent double Oscar nominee for Jojo Rabbit and Marriage Story — says she and Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige first discussed a potential solo film during the press tour for 2012’s The Avengers, as just “a tiny speck of an idea.” As fellow Avengers like Thor and Captain America got stand-alone sequels and threequels, Natasha continued to evolve within the main MCU story line until her death in Endgame, a noble finale for a character who dedicated her hero career to trying to right past wrongs. “We had been planning the conclusion for the Infinity Saga for the past five or six years, and Natasha’s journey within those films took the priority,” Feige explains. “The notion of breaking out for a stand-alone film that takes place in the past, for a character that we already knew and were already following, didn’t feel right.” Even as journalists and fans repeatedly asked Johansson when Black Widow would be going solo, the actress was privately unsure whether that was something she even wanted. “I was like, I think I’m good,” Johansson admits. “If we going to do this, it had to be creatively fulfilling. I’ve been working for such a long time, and I have to feel like I’m challenged. I don’t want to do the same thing that I’d already done before.” What changed her mind was a meeting with Shortland, an Australian director known for her introspective, female-fronted indies like 2004’s Somersault. “We just bonded over stories about trust and about intimacy and about women surviving,” Shortland says of that initial chat. “You didn’t have to be a superhero to identify with a woman who has had a really tough childhood and has survived and has a huge heart and helps other people.” Shortland — the first solo female director in the MCU’s history — hadn’t planned to pivot to superhero movies, but she was intrigued by Black Widow’s resilience (and lack of superpowers). Says Weisz, 50: “Even though this is a fantastical universe, the way Cate directs, I think it’s quite real.” “When I looked at the past films, there’s a lot of sitting outside of the character, so that she is seen and kind of objectified,” Shortland adds. “Oftentimes we don’t really get to see who she is when she’s by herself — who she is when she takes off the action-hero facade.” Much of Black Widow peels away that facade. Over the years, Marvel has sprinkled in cryptic allusions to Nat’s past — a reference to Budapest here, a Red Room flashback there — but the new film dives deeper. “A prequel that simply filled in the blanks of things you already know is not very exciting,” Feige says. “How does she get her Widow stingers for the first time? How did she learn to do a flip? That doesn’t matter.” What does matter is the people surrounding Natasha and how they helped shape her sense of self. With the Avengers AWOL, she turns to the only other kin she’s ever had: a hodgepodge band of Russian spies who went undercover together as a family when Natasha was a child. There’s Weisz as the mysterious Melina, who also trained as a Widow. There’s Florence Pugh (who’s also a recent Oscar nominee) as Yelena Belova, a no-nonsense Red Room alum whom Nat views as an estranged little sister. (Like many sisters, they settle differences by beating the crap out of each other.) And there’s David Harbour as Alexei, a.k.a. the Red Guardian, the Russian answer to Captain America (if Cap was a bearded, past-his-prime goofball). “I thought it would be a straightforward action movie, and then it wound up being a real character study of a dysfunctional family,” Harbour, 45, says. To play that familial bond, the cast had to get close — really close. Johansson and Pugh had met only a few times before they filmed their first scene together: a brutal smackdown between Natasha and Yelena, who haven’t seen each other in years. “Immediately we were in each other’s space, like, ‘All right, I’m going to grab your armpit, and you put your hand under my knee in a pretzel,’” Johansson recalls. “I remember thinking at the time, ‘That is one way of getting to know one another,’” Pugh, 24, adds with a laugh. The Avengers may have a diverse female roster now, but in 2010, Black Widow was the MCU’s only female Avenger. Now, with films like Captain Marvel and Wonder Woman topping the box office, a woman-led superhero flick is far less of a novelty. For Johansson, it’s a welcome shift, and although it’s been gradual, she says she felt it most while filming Infinity War and Endgame, battling aliens alongside Danai Gurira’s Okoye and Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch, or watching Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel step on set for the first time. “For anyone who said to me, ‘Oh, this should’ve happened five or 10 years ago,’ I’m like, it would not have been as substantial. We just would not have been able to do it. This film is happening now as a result of what’s going on in the zeitgeist, and I think it’s pretty cool.” The key, Johansson argues, is not just casting female heroes but telling distinctly female stories. (She remembers being told once that the Black Widow movie “could be like Bourne, but with a woman.”) “I think this character’s strength really lies in her vulnerability and her acceptance of that,” she says. “She has emotional intelligence that has allowed her to survive without any real superpowers. She’s someone who is a problem-solver. She’s a pragmatic person. I think a lot of those qualities are inherently female.” And although Natasha may have met her end at the bottom of that cliff on Vormir, Johansson wants her legacy to live on. “I hope that this film continues pushing that boundary, so that we can actually have more female superheroes who are inherently female, and aren’t just Batman in heels or whatever,” she adds. In the meantime, Johansson has to finish this female-superhero movie. As the release date nears, she and Shortland have been in the edit bay making last-minute tweaks. This film marks the first time Johansson has taken on an executive-producer role for the MCU, and she admits that she feels protective over Nat and how her story is received. “When we did San Diego Comic-Con , I remember being so scared and nervous,” Pugh recalls of taking the stage with Johansson. “And when we came off the stage we held hands, and she was just as nervous.” For its star, Black Widow is the culmination of a decade-long effort; and, as Johansson points out, Natasha isn’t the only one who’s changed over the years. “This film is very much a result of that journey, my own personal journey,” she says. “I feel that I probably wasn’t as willing or able to go to the kind of uncomfortable, embarrassing, ugly places before. I think it’s just as you get older, you trust yourself more.” After all, sometimes spies get the best results not by donning disguises but by stripping them away. “Maybe I wouldn’t even have been as curious about that part of before,” Johansson says. “Maybe I would’ve been more interested in wearing all these masks, and now I’m more interested in what’s behind them.” To read more on Black Widow, pick up the new issue of Entertainment Weekly beginning on Tuesday, March 17, or buy it here now.

I don’t want to do the same thing that I’d already done before.” What changed her mind was a meeting with Shortland, an Australian director known for her introspective, female-fronted indies like 2004’s Somersault. “We just bonded over stories about trust and about intimacy and about women surviving,” Shortland says of that initial chat. “You didn’t have to be a superhero to identify with a woman who has had a really tough childhood and has survived and has a huge heart and helps other people.” Shortland — the first solo female director in the MCU’s history — hadn’t planned to pivot to superhero movies, but she was intrigued by Black Widow’s resilience (and lack of superpowers). Says Weisz, 50: “Even though this is a fantastical universe, the way Cate directs, I think it’s quite real.” “When I looked at the past films, there’s a lot of sitting outside of the character, so that she is seen and kind of objectified,” Shortland adds. “Oftentimes we don’t really get to see who she is when she’s by herself — who she is when she takes off the action-hero facade.” Much of Black Widow peels away that facade. Over the years, Marvel has sprinkled in cryptic allusions to Nat’s past — a reference to Budapest here, a Red Room flashback there — but the new film dives deeper. “A prequel that simply filled in the blanks of things you already know is not very exciting,” Feige says. “How does she get her Widow stingers for the first time? How did she learn to do a flip? That doesn’t matter.” What does matter is the people surrounding Natasha and how they helped shape her sense of self. With the Avengers AWOL, she turns to the only other kin she’s ever had: a hodgepodge band of Russian spies who went undercover together as a family when Natasha was a child. There’s Weisz as the mysterious Melina, who also trained as a Widow. There’s Florence Pugh (who’s also a recent Oscar nominee) as Yelena Belova, a no-nonsense Red Room alum whom Nat views as an estranged little sister. (Like many sisters, they settle differences by beating the crap out of each other.) And there’s David Harbour as Alexei, a.k.a. the Red Guardian, the Russian answer to Captain America (if Cap was a bearded, past-his-prime goofball). “I thought it would be a straightforward action movie, and then it wound up being a real character study of a dysfunctional family,” Harbour, 45, says. To play that familial bond, the cast had to get close — really close. Johansson and Pugh had met only a few times before they filmed their first scene together: a brutal smackdown between Natasha and Yelena, who haven’t seen each other in years. “Immediately we were in each other’s space, like, ‘All right, I’m going to grab your armpit, and you put your hand under my knee in a pretzel,’” Johansson recalls. “I remember thinking at the time, ‘That is one way of getting to know one another,’” Pugh, 24, adds with a laugh. The Avengers may have a diverse female roster now, but in 2010, Black Widow was the MCU’s only female Avenger. Now, with films like Captain Marvel and Wonder Woman topping the box office, a woman-led superhero flick is far less of a novelty. For Johansson, it’s a welcome shift, and although it’s been gradual, she says she felt it most while filming Infinity War and Endgame, battling aliens alongside Danai Gurira’s Okoye and Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch, or watching Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel step on set for the first time. “For anyone who said to me, ‘Oh, this should’ve happened five or 10 years ago,’ I’m like, it would not have been as substantial. We just would not have been able to do it. This film is happening now as a result of what’s going on in the zeitgeist, and I think it’s pretty cool.” The key, Johansson argues, is not just casting female heroes but telling distinctly female stories. (She remembers being told once that the Black Widow movie “could be like Bourne, but with a woman.”) “I think this character’s strength really lies in her vulnerability and her acceptance of that,” she says. “She has emotional intelligence that has allowed her to survive without any real superpowers. She’s someone who is a problem-solver. She’s a pragmatic person. I think a lot of those qualities are inherently female.” And although Natasha may have met her end at the bottom of that cliff on Vormir, Johansson wants her legacy to live on. “I hope that this film continues pushing that boundary, so that we can actually have more female superheroes who are inherently female, and aren’t just Batman in heels or whatever,” she adds. In the meantime, Johansson has to finish this female-superhero movie. As the release date nears, she and Shortland have been in the edit bay making last-minute tweaks. This film marks the first time Johansson has taken on an executive-producer role for the MCU, and she admits that she feels protective over Nat and how her story is received. “When we did San Diego Comic-Con , I remember being so scared and nervous,” Pugh recalls of taking the stage with Johansson. “And when we came off the stage we held hands, and she was just as nervous.” For its star, Black Widow is the culmination of a decade-long effort; and, as Johansson points out, Natasha isn’t the only one who’s changed over the years. “This film is very much a result of that journey, my own personal journey,” she says. “I feel that I probably wasn’t as willing or able to go to the kind of uncomfortable, embarrassing, ugly places before. I think it’s just as you get older, you trust yourself more.” After all, sometimes spies get the best results not by donning disguises but by stripping them away. “Maybe I wouldn’t even have been as curious about that part of before,” Johansson says. “Maybe I would’ve been more interested in wearing all these masks, and now I’m more interested in what’s behind them.” To read more on Black Widow, pick up the new issue of Entertainment Weekly beginning on Tuesday, March 17, or buy it here now.

Let’s see who inspired Blake Shelton, John Legend, Nick Jonas, and Kelly Clarkson enough to give up some precious spots on their teams. Anaya Cheyenne, 16, Atlanta, Ga. // “I’ll Never Love Again”This child has her own theme song, what more does she need?! I mean, I guess a spot on The Voice would be nice after moving away from her mother to pursue music and performing arts in Atlanta. But still, a theme song! Anaya starts out a little hesitant but holy hell if this girl doesn’t do runs that basically hit every single note in existence. Blake waits to see if Kelly is going to turn for this big-voiced pop vocalist — clearly, her wheelhouse — and then turns as soon as she does. He tries to sell his “sometimes the best artist-coach combos are the ones that don’t make sense” line but everyone else is like, um, you should really be with Kelly if you have pipes like that.Coach: Team Kelly, of course. Mandi Thomas, 33, Memphis, Tenn. // “Time To Say Goodbye” It’s a real blind and it is AN OPERA SINGER. Kelly Clarkson’s prayers have been answered. None of the other judges even want to touch Mandi because they have no idea how to handle a voice like hers, so Kelly, thankfully, doesn’t have to fight for this classically trained singer. Mandi can sing anything but wanted to show off something different. Her voice is a true instrument, so it’ll be interesting to see what songs Kelly and Mandi choose in later rounds and how she holds her own against more contemporary-sounding artists.Coach: Team Kelly is two-for-two tonight! Ari Tibi, 27, Calabasas, Calif. // “The Joke” Our third female vocalist in a row hails from a female trio folk-pop band. You can tell she’s polished and comfortable up there on stage, but the performance is lacking an emotional connection and there are some sour notes throughout. All of the judges are basically like, yeah, you’re obviously talented, but you could do this song much better. They all want her to come back again. That’s some positive feedback in a less-than-positive situation.Coach: n/a Jacob Miller, 29, Eden, Wis. // “The Times They Are a-Changin'” Oh, friends, I’m excited about this one. Jacob is a songwriter and performer who plays ragtime and jazz and thinks his musical tastes would fit better in the 1920s than today. Also, he’s insane on the guitar. He’s got a great sound that will really stand out on this show. Please, please The Voice, don’t ruin him. Kelly, Blake, and Nick all turn. Kelly would love to bring his sound to new audiences by blending with contemporary music. Blake wants to protect what Jacob does at all costs. And Nick mainly sounds interested in working with him so that he can collaborate with the Jonas Brothers. An interesting pitch tactic!Coach: Against all odds, Jacob joins Team Nick! Jacob Jonas it is, I guess. Jon Mullins, 32, Nashville, Tenn. // “Don’t Give Up On Me”Jon is a full-time musician in Nashville and three years ago, his wife suffered brain injuries after a fall. They’re on the other side of it now, but this is all for her — and you can feel that extra-emotion in Jon’s performance. This guy’s voice is so commercial and he has such a big, beautiful range, I’m surprised he ends up being a one-chair turn. And it’s not just any one chair. It’s a Blake Shelton one chair. Being a Nashville guy, Jon seems pretty pumped about it and is beyond grateful to be “on the team with the king.” Blake will never let being called the king go. He has been coronated, it is decided. The crowd chants “King Blake,” he is our master now.Coach: Team Blake, baby. Jacob Daniel Murphy, 27, Elk Grove, Calif. // “Until You Come Back to Me (That’s What I’m Gonna Do)” Well, at the very least, Blake is becoming the King of One Chair Turns. Incredible, Jacob Daniel Murphy completely THROWS DOWN on this song, with a big range and lots of connection, and no one turns until the very end when Blake finally goes. He explains that he assumed he’d have no chance and so wasn’t going to bother, but when he saw no one was going, he felt like he was “robbing a bank.” Blake is impressed with Jacob’s great pitch, big range, and controlled runs. It might not be a likely pairing, but we know how Blake feels about those.Coach: Another easy pickup for Team Blake. Zan Fiskum, 22, Seattle, Wash. // “Light On” Zan lives in an RV in her parents’ backyard as she tries to make a living as a musician. I love Zan. She’s very much in the indie-pop/folk world and she owns it. Her voice is clear and precise, and as John notes, she somehow has both power behind her vocals and can easily slip into a more ethereal vibe. She’s both polished and able to connect emotionally. She’s a great get for any team, which is why Kelly, Nick, and yes, John Legend in his first chair turn of the night, all fight for her. Zan makes it look effortless, and everyone wants someone like that on their team.Coach: This could go any way, but in the end, Zan feels like John would be the best fit for her style, so she joins Team Legend. Chan Fuze, 23, Chicago, Ill. // “Groove Me” Dang, Kelly Clarkson is so right: The Voice is just not the right settling for Chan to thrive. This man is 6-foot-10, rocks a velvet button-down like he was born in it, and has some moves. Unfortunately, none of this matters when the coaches can’t see you. Poor Chan here gets zero chair turns. Blake thinks that there was too much emphasis on the showman part of the performance and not enough on the singing. John doesn’t think Chan’s falsetto was “as effective” as it needed to be. None of this gets Chan down though, he is still a party in human form.Coach: n/a Roderick Chambers, 38, Miami, Fla. // “Back At One” When Roderick started off with the Brian McKnight JAM, both Kelly and I jumped. More Brian McKnight on this show, please! Roderick has been a musician for most of his life, he was in a group with his brother when he was younger, but has since been living as a solo musician in Miami. It’s not the most dynamic audition we’ve seen this evening, but Nick is right — Roderick has a voice that could sound great on anything. John compares Roderick’s tone to Nick’s, so maybe this one-chair turn is working out for the best.Coach: It’s Team Nick always and forever here. Jules, 15, Peoria, Ariz. // “Ain’t No Rest for the Wicked” Jules is only 15 but has been playing guitar since she was six, and gigging since she was 12. That is a hard-working teenager, you guys! It shows because Jules walks up on stage with a lot of confidence — she does her own arrangement on this song to set herself apart. Her poor dad looks like he might pass out at any moment and he has to wait until the very end to find some relief. Both Blake and Kelly turn at the last minute. Kelly loves that a 15-year-old girl has such control over her lower register and can’t believe she has such a mature voice for being so young. Blake says something about the Arizona Cardinals.Coach: Her family is pushing Blake, but Miss Independent joins Team Kelly (you’re welcome!). Jared Harper 22, San Francisco, Calif. // “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” Jared, who is deaf in his right ear, was inspired by Maelyn Jarmon and is here on The Voice to take the next step in his music career. Unfortunately, he never really connects with the song and ends up with no chair turns. Blake was waiting for the energy to be kicked up a notch and both he and John note some pitch problems that made them hesitant to turn.Coach: n/a Michael Williams 18, Mason, Ohio // “You Say” Look at this little cutie! Michael has a digestive disorder and, at one point, never expected to feel well enough to perform again. He’s got a big range but doesn’t quite hit the high note in his falsetto — which is exactly why Nick Jonas turns his chair for him. Nick had to work long and hard on his falsetto and he wants to get Michael’s into shape. Nick is really winning me over with pitches like this. He’s giving this kid a chance!Coach: Team Nick, but sing it in falsetto. Mike Jerel, 31, Ashburn, Ga. “It’s A Man’s, Man’s, Man’s World”The Voice clearly saved the best for last tonight. After a whole slew of one-chair turns, we’re ending the evening with a four-chair turn, baby. Everyone wants a piece of Mike Jerel. Oh, you guys, he is SO GOOD. There’s intensity and emotion and complete control of both his voice and the piano. The place goes crazy. Honestly, has John Legend ever been this excited about a potential artist joining his team? Everyone assumes Mike is going to pick John, but holy hell do they fight anyway. Kelly’s pitch is particularly, at least momentarily, persuasive: She makes sure Mike knows that on John’s team, he’ll be fighting for spots with every other singer who plays piano on this show, but she has no male artists and no pianists on her team. It’s all him. None of this matters though because Mike’s mom wants him to pick John.Coach: Team Legend — come on, you can’t go against mom.

He’s looking for the perfect, vintage… Shotput? Workout accessory? Bludgeoning device? A diverse collection of objects is put to the heft test: a TV, a teakettle, a kettlebell. A mallet. A typewriter. A Buddha sculpture. A bowling ball? No, even better: three bowling balls. We’ll have to wait until much later to find out the purpose of Jimmy’s shopping excursion. For now, we cut to the title credits and then to Jimmy and Kim’s apartment. There’s a half-eaten pizza sitting on the coffee table, and the couple is asleep and nude — but between the pizza and the pair of Jimmy’s shoes that are propped atop each other in a way that suggests removal by a very, very drunk person, the whole vibe is distinctly unsexy. Less post-coital bliss, more the kind of naked where you wake up with a mouth that tastes like a trash can and no memory of having removed your clothes. Kim is determined to clean up the mess she made, starting with the busted beer bottles she chucked into the parking lot last night. While she sweeps, she consults with her assistant about property records for the Mesa Verde call center in Tucumcari — clearly formulating a plan, confident that she can fix things. Jimmy, meanwhile, has an appointment with the ambiguously dumb duo previously seen painting the town red in “50% Off.” This meeting plays out pretty much as you’d expect: of course the guys thought they could pay Jimmy’s fee with the money they stole, and of course they have no other funds. One of them has a grandma he can hit up for cash, which Jimmy tells him to do — and that’s it for now, but probably not for good. (What are the chances that the grandma in question is someone Jimmy knows from his previous life as an honest elder law attorney? What are the chances this ends well? Discuss.) From there, Jimmy heads to the only nice restaurant in town (or at least the only one we ever see), where we find out what Howard Hamlin has been up to since last season. Over drinks, Howard asks Jimmy some cursory questions about Saul Goodman, but it’s Jimmy he really wants — as an employee. Ah, yes: all it took was a series of ridiculous scandals and the tragic suicide of one of the firm’s namesakes, but Howard Hamlin has finally decided that he wants his boy, “Charlie Hustle,” on the roster at HHM, and the only thing more fascinating than the barely-masked resentment on Jimmy’s face is that Howard somehow doesn’t see it. He’s so distracted by the shiny prospect of his own redemption, finally being the good guy, that he’s blind to the fact that it’s much too little, much too late. But just in case you’re not sure how you’re supposed to feel about Howard in this scene, do enjoy the too-long, too-close hug he gives Jimmy before driving away in his valet-parked sports car with a vanity plate that says… NAMAST3. This, too, will not end well. While Howard Hamlin drives off into the sunset, Saul Goodman has an afternoon in court, defending a client accused of robbery, and Kim shows up to watch the action just as a Mr. Harkness takes the witness stand. (Fun fact: Although his name didn’t appear in the credits, that’s definitely Tim de Zarn, the wonderful character actor who played Mordecai the Harbinger of Doom in Joss Whedon’s Cabin in the Woods.) Harkness points to the bearded man sitting at the defense table: There’s the robber, he says. Your client. Jimmy pushes him: Is he sure? Did he really get a good look? The witness insists that yes, it’s the man at the defense table who robbed him, at which point Jimmy reveals that the guy at the defense table… isn’t his client. Ha! The real Slim Shady stands up — he’s been seated in the gallery while a doppelganger with similar facial hair took his place at the defense table — and the whole courtroom erupts. “Mr. Goodman!”, the judge scolds, and Jimmy grins, totally in his element. “You didn’t recognize him either, your Honor.” These are the sort of courtroom antics that have always made Kim uncomfortable, but this time, they’re exactly what she’s here for. Earlier, we saw her try and fail to convince Mesa Verde to choose another location (read: one not already occupied by a cantankerous senior citizen) for their call center. If she wants to do right by Mr. Acker, she’d better call… you-know-who. Some time later, Saul Goodman knocks at the door of Acker’s home and presents him with a proposal for legal services, and by “proposal,” we mean “a picture of a man having sex with a horse.” But it’s a metaphor: Saul is the man, Mesa Verde is the horse, and — once again, and much like man-on-horse carnal relations — this probably won’t end well, either. Not for the horse, but also not for the horse’s lead counsel. Meanwhile, it’s time for yet another crowd-pleasing cameo from everyone’s favorite DEA agents, as Hank and Steve stake out a dead drop to see if Krazy-8’s information is good. The scene is intercut with a tense interaction at Los Pollos Hermanos, as a stressed-out Gus waits for the phone to ring and passes the time by terrorizing his kitchen manager over an inadequately-maintained deep fryer, but let’s be real, it’s Hank’s ambient musing about the etymology of the word “culvert” that really brings the drama here. At the end of the night, the DEA has bagged nearly a million bucks in drug money and arrested several low-level guys — all according to Gus Fring’s plan. (Also, in case you were wondering, the origins of “culvert” are unknown, but the Dutch word for crotch rot is “kruis rot.”) It went down like it was supposed to. That’s what Victor tells Gus after the DEA raids the dead drops, but it feels more broadly true. This whole episode has a sense of doors closing and destinies taking shape. Jimmy, finally given the chance to come aboard at the firm that already bears his name, doesn’t just decline the offer; he pitches a bowling ball through the back window of Howard Hamlin’s car. (Namaste!) Kim, instead of saying a serenity prayer and getting on with her work, sets up her biggest client for a humiliating setback in court. But at the very end, all this inevitability is balanced out by mystery: Mike, still spiraling over Werner’s death and his unresolved guilt over Matty, goes out once again looking for a fight — and wakes up on a goat farm in the middle of nowhere. Where is he? How did he get there? And most importantly, to whom does he now owe his life?

He’s looking for the perfect, vintage… Shotput? Workout accessory? Bludgeoning device? A diverse collection of objects is put to the heft test: a TV, a teakettle, a kettlebell. A mallet. A typewriter. A Buddha sculpture. A bowling ball? No, even better: three bowling balls. We’ll have to wait until much later to find out the purpose of Jimmy’s shopping excursion. For now, we cut to the title credits and then to Jimmy and Kim’s apartment. There’s a half-eaten pizza sitting on the coffee table, and the couple is asleep and nude — but between the pizza and the pair of Jimmy’s shoes that are propped atop each other in a way that suggests removal by a very, very drunk person, the whole vibe is distinctly unsexy. Less post-coital bliss, more the kind of naked where you wake up with a mouth that tastes like a trash can and no memory of having removed your clothes. Kim is determined to clean up the mess she made, starting with the busted beer bottles she chucked into the parking lot last night. While she sweeps, she consults with her assistant about property records for the Mesa Verde call center in Tucumcari — clearly formulating a plan, confident that she can fix things. Jimmy, meanwhile, has an appointment with the ambiguously dumb duo previously seen painting the town red in “50% Off.” This meeting plays out pretty much as you’d expect: of course the guys thought they could pay Jimmy’s fee with the money they stole, and of course they have no other funds. One of them has a grandma he can hit up for cash, which Jimmy tells him to do — and that’s it for now, but probably not for good. (What are the chances that the grandma in question is someone Jimmy knows from his previous life as an honest elder law attorney? What are the chances this ends well? Discuss.) From there, Jimmy heads to the only nice restaurant in town (or at least the only one we ever see), where we find out what Howard Hamlin has been up to since last season. Over drinks, Howard asks Jimmy some cursory questions about Saul Goodman, but it’s Jimmy he really wants — as an employee. Ah, yes: all it took was a series of ridiculous scandals and the tragic suicide of one of the firm’s namesakes, but Howard Hamlin has finally decided that he wants his boy, “Charlie Hustle,” on the roster at HHM, and the only thing more fascinating than the barely-masked resentment on Jimmy’s face is that Howard somehow doesn’t see it. He’s so distracted by the shiny prospect of his own redemption, finally being the good guy, that he’s blind to the fact that it’s much too little, much too late. But just in case you’re not sure how you’re supposed to feel about Howard in this scene, do enjoy the too-long, too-close hug he gives Jimmy before driving away in his valet-parked sports car with a vanity plate that says… NAMAST3. This, too, will not end well. While Howard Hamlin drives off into the sunset, Saul Goodman has an afternoon in court, defending a client accused of robbery, and Kim shows up to watch the action just as a Mr. Harkness takes the witness stand.

These are the existential questions that pose themselves aboard the Avenue 5, where focus has finally turned away from the constellation of glowing turds orbiting the ship, and back to the actual s—show happening inside it. Since realizing that shedding the weight of 500 people could cut their ETA to Earth down from three-and-a-half years to six months, Karen has started coordinating the collection of non-essential items to toss in lieu of the original tossing plan from a few episodes ago: her husband, Frank. For Karen, non-essential items include loafers but not stilettos, and children’s animals of both the stuffed and living variety: “Oh my, this is going to be a tough life lesson, right?” For his part, Captain Clark is working hard under Billie’s tutelage to learn to fly the ship since his fingerprints are the only ones paired with the emergency protocol when it comes time to dock the Avenue 5. It’s not going great! “Was that a good explosion?” Captain Clark asks when the flight simulator blows up on all of the screens surrounding him?” “Well… we were in it,” Billie replies, and at this point, that could be spun as a positive or a negative. Because no one living aboard the Avenue 5 is doing very well right now, including Herman Judd, whose self-described moods exclusively include “elation and genius.” But when Judd hears from Matt that Captain Clark has a major sedatives problem, and subsequently hears from Captain Clark that the sedatives he was collecting were in fact intended to sedate Judd during the recent beeping incident, Judd fires Captain Clark. Which Captain Clark quickly matches by quitting, announcing: “I’m done tugging my forelock—in fact, you can fucking have my forelock!” If, like me, you weren’t familiar with the term “forelock,” it’s the front bit of one’s hair. And if, like me, you have a passing familiarity with Hugh Laurie’s hairline, but have grown accustomed to Captain Clark’s picture perfect coif, then prepare for perhaps the biggest twist of Avenue 5’s extremely twisty plot thus far… “You’re British and bald,” Iris screams as Captain Clark tugs his wig off revealing a completely average head of middle-aged hair. “Balding,” Captain Clark clarifies as the nearby passengers begin breaking into hysterics with the realization that not only is their captain balding, he’s also their former captain now. “Re-hair yourself, please,” Judd begs. “I’ll re-captain you!” But Captain Clark doesn’t want to be re-captained. He heads back out into the Avenue 5 as a civilian, and Spike is named the interim captain of the ship. That’s when things really start going downhill. Not because Spike is a bad captain, but because he actually has a working knowledge of how space ships should function, and a bridge deck full of models who say the same three lines over and over isn’t a part of that. And while Spike is catching onto something shady on the bridge, the Avenue 5 passengers have begun to connect a few (less credible) dots of their own. One particularly vocal passenger works in VFX — “that stands for visual effects,” she’ll be quick to tell you — back on Earth, and she starts spreading the word that some things aboard the Avenue 5 seem reminiscent of a movie set. Like the captain suddenly being out of costume and speaking in a different accent…and the décor falling off the walls like cheap props…and the bridge crew openly admitting to being actors. And while all of that is certainly suspicious, and could make one think that perhaps all of this chaos has actually just been some sort of simulation for a reality show, and maybe they’ve actually remained on earth this whole time… None of it should be enough to convince a grown adult that they should go through the airlock and test that theory. But as Captain Clark says to the mob mounting near the airlock yelling that they’re clearly on a reality show: “Wow, you guys are stupid, even for rich people.” “Hey, don’t talk to rich people like that!” Judd defends. Because even he — the owner of this ship — is getting a little confused by the argument that none of this is real, and maybe if they just go through the airlock, they’ll be whisked away to a green room and back to their families. The couple that left their son in a coma to come on a luxury vacation are particularly convinced by this argument, so when Matt announces the air lock code in an attempt at a sort of reverse psychology (and his armchair psychologist rap sheet had been flawless to this point!), the father of the coma-son rushes into the airlock. The outer doors open to release him either to outer space or a production set, and everyone looks on hopefully… As his eyeballs explode out of their sockets, his body freezes, and he floats out into the great unknown. Which VFX lady naturally convinces everyone could have just been done with special effects. So then the man’s wife and Mr. Harrison decide to take their stab at getting back to earth, rushing the airlock themselves. And when the doors open… Their eyes explode out of their sockets, and their bodies freeze, and they float out into space. In the chaos of it all, Sarah/Sara charges the airlock along with three other passengers, and their eyeballs explode, their bodies freeze, et cetera, et cetera. “Well you laughing gnome, you still think it’s visual fucking effects?” Captain Clark asks. “Okay, well the ‘f’ doesn’t stand for ‘f—ing,’ but I will admit that I’m on the fence,” VFX lady replies after watching 14 individual eyeballs explode. During all of this, Rav is making her way toward the Avenue 5 aboard the supplies rocket that only has one available seat for the return to earth, and since Judd intends on taking it, Rav has had to spend the ride convincing herself that maybe life aboard a luxury space ship with just a slight prison vibe is still overall better than the media frenzy she’s been dealing with at Mission Control. As juuust as she’s about made it to that mental conclusion…seven eyeball-less bodies hit the windshield of the supplies rocket. A FEW SPACE NUGGETS Iris and Billie were particularly savage this episode. “Back off buddy, or you will feel my wrath,” Iris tells Mr. Harrison when he threatens Mr. Judd. “I am fire — literally fire — and I will burn the jelly in your fat eyes and use your tongue to wipe surfaces with!” “These people are so dumb. I am just hanging out with pigs and dolphins when we get back.” –Billie, not wrong, as usual While collecting non-essential items to eject from the ship, Karen tells people to ask themselves if they would exchange their trinkets for a human life: “Because basically everything we own right now — blood diamonds.” While Matt goes full Kondo for all items, including teddy bears: “Here’s what we’re gonna do little man, we’re gonna thank him for his service — and then send him to his death.” The Future Is Now: “You guys know bloody marys? It’s an old drink named after this woman who liked to set Protestants on fire.” “I’m just gonna listen to this true crime podcast about that Greta Gerwig thing … everyone has a theory on it.” Related content: HBO’s amusing Avenue 5 sends Hugh Laurie into orbit: Review Avenue 5 recap: Prepare for penury", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "ew.com", "priority": 72, "ts": 1769974447, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "e33b14e40876f91bb5b82a48d75e849996f50fdd", "post_id": "http://ew.com/?post_type=recap&p=6631255", "source": "rss", "event_type": "item", "title": "‘Avenue 5’ season 1 episode 8 recap: ‘This is Physically Hurting Me’", "body": "Why throw enough teddy bears and golf clubs out of the Avenue 5 to equal 500 people’s body weight when — if you just give them long enough — those 500 people might convince themselves that they’ve been living in a space simulation for the last six months, and happily walk themselves right off the ship and into outer space where their eyeballs will explode out of their sockets in the less-than-one-second it takes for their bodies to freeze straight through?

However, in a time where our world (and, sure, maybe even the galaxy) has been thrust into mass hysteria and people are hoarding toilet paper as though they might soon participate in their own personal turd-orbit … these moments of space-chaos were somehow both funny and poignant. While the Avenue 5 writers couldn’t have known the specific state the world would be in when they wrote this finale, the series has always been about the ways in which people begin panicking in the face of impending disaster, while simultaneously denying the reality of their own doom, making it worse through their own selfishness, and ignoring the few people who actually know what they’re talking about. And tonight, that funhouse mirror just slid right into place, didn’t it?! To quote Captain Clark, the fake captain of a luxury spaceship orbited by human feces whose only value is his fingerprints: “We just watched seven people stupid themselves to death.” Ever the agent of chaos, Matt has changed the code to the airlocks and hidden himself somewhere in the ship so as not to cause any more harm after watching seven people happily march to their space-deaths with the code he gave them last week. The other assembled main characters briefly believe that Matt’s message means he’s gone to kill himself and flood his inbox with messages encouraging him not to do that after Captain Clark first sends him a bracelet-butt-dial voice recording that says, “Life without you would be,” looooong pause, “the only word I could think of was easier!” And everyone else’s overlapping messages are just as in line with their own personalities including, “Hey Matt, it’s Judd from work … you’re the son I never had, the lover I never wanted,” and capped off perfectly by Iris: “Matt, those people were fucking idiots, we’re better off with them, now give us the goddamn codes.” Billie makes the startling announcement that if they don’t get the airlock code to jettison the excess weight off of the ship within the hour, they’ll be stuck with the original three and a half year trajectory. Not to mention, as Cyrus notes, they need that code to retrieve Captain Joe’s hands and head to take control of the ship’s steering for their emergency docking since Captain Clark stands no chance of being able to do it himself. So everyone splits up to search for Matt while Karen and Iris — a formidable duo if ever there was one — are tasked with ramping up the donations for jettisoning. And that formidable duo becomes a terrifying trio as Rav finally makes her way onboard and finds out from the passengers dragging their guitars and dumbbells to be thrown off the ship that seven humans also recently decided to throw themselves off. “Is that it — just a simple ‘Rav?!'” Rav screams when Iris calmly greets her while dragging a giant golden horse out of Judd’s cabin. “See, I was expecting something more along the lines of, uh, ‘Sorry for surrounding our groundbreaking luxury cruise liner with s— and corpses.'” But this is a luxury poop-and-cadaver cruise of everyone’s making, not just Iris. Or, as Matt informs Judd and Captain Clark while they roam the lower deck of the ship screaming his name in a high-pitched voice and find him casually getting a candy bar from the vending machines: “Well … we’re all hiding.” And while Matt has been hiding and plunging the ship into chaos once more, he’s been carefully itemizing his thoughts. Though 309: “Every year we pass the pre-anniversary of our death, but we don’t even know it, so we don’t get presents.” And thought 14: “Poor octopus — eight arms, but no hands. F— you, God!” And like the eight handless arms of the hopeless being that they are, the whole gang suddenly converges at Matt’s non-hiding spot. They all demand that he give them the code, but Matt doesn’t give it up until Rav threatens physical violence after just proving her merit by backhanding Judd to Jupiter. The code is 0-0-0-5 for Avenue 5: “I made it so that anyone thinking rationally would be able to guess it, and anyone thinking irrationally, anyone suicidal, would not.” Judd, thinking only of himself, sprints away toward the supply shuttle to catch his ride back to Earth, and everyone races after him. Karen is busy threatening to take people’s teeth if they don’t get their final jettisoning items to her, but she soon also joins the gang, just in time to see Judd board the supply ship. Judd demands that the pilot “go, go go!” but the pilot tells him it doesn’t work that way; he’s just there to press two buttons at the right time and the rest is automated. So in the meantime, Jordan the comedian asks Judd through the speaker system why he would want to go back to Earth since everyone hates him there on account of that time when Judd contemplated mass murder. And when Judd comes bustling off the ship, Jordan sprints onboard before anyone knows what’s happened. “Jordan, I did like you, but I am very, very weird!” Billie yells at him, correctly. After the pilot deboards to change his travel catheter, Doug grabs Mia’s hand in an act of passion, and rushes on board the supply ship, wrestling Jordan out of there and claiming the two seats as their own… Until Cyrus returns from his mission outside with Captain Joe’s head and hands (all of which have exploded beyond use), and Captain Clark goes absolutely nuts, his British accent raising to a decibel we’ve yet to hear. “That’s it!” he screams as he rushes on the supply ship. “My patience has snapped like a 100-year-old breadstick! I am the captain still, and I decide who stays and who goes!” And even though he wasn’t asking for that person to be him, everyone just sort of decides it should be. “You’re very unhappy,” Matt tells him. “You know that thing you do, where you act sarcastic so we all feel sorry for you? It works — we do.” Everyone raises their hand in an emotional salute as the pilot hits his second button and the ship truly begins its final countdown to whisk Captain Clark back to Earth… Well, everyone except Billie, who stands there with her arms crossed until Captain Clark realizes he has to stay because he’s still the only one who can steer the ship. Captain Clark deboards, Jordan rushes on again, and as the supply ship countdown grows lower, Karen also starts the countdown for the jettison. She’s gathered enough items, and they’ll make it just under the hour that Billie forewarned. And as two clashing countdowns, both in Judd’s voice, play at once, that familiar feeling of chaos begins to descend: “This is like psychosis but with none of the advantages!” Iris now rushes on board the supply ship to physically remove Jordan so that Mr. Judd can come on board as was the original plan. And while Judd is refusing because he doesn’t want to go back to Earth where he’s hated, the countdown for the jettison completes, and the ship shakes as the items weighing as much as 500 people are launched into space. “We just jettisoned from the portside airlocks, we’re gonna be home in six months baby,” Karen proudly announces. “You jettisoned out of the rear, not the portside” Billie corrects, as Billie is wont to do. But Karen meant what she said. Captain Clark begin screaming at Karen that the whole point was to launch the weight out of the back of the ship to propel them forward. “You’ve gotta s— out of the back of the ship — this is basic s—ing!” As everyone yells that even babies know how to s— correctly, Karen crumbles realizing her mistake — “I feel like I’m dying and my teeth are falling off!” — demanding that Frank do something worse to take the attention off of her. But nothing could be worse than what Karen has done. Cyrus announces that their new earliest trajectory for a potential rescue is… “Eight years?!” Matt yells. “That’s longer than the Beatles were together; that’s longer than the Seven Years’ War!” And with that, the doors to the supply shuttle slam shut with Iris still inside, and Judd still on the ship screaming her name. “Do you think she can hear me?” he asks Captain Clark. A FEW SPACE NUGGETS: No, but you may as well keep screaming, indeed, folks! This is the last chance to mention it, so I should mention it: the score of Avenue 5 has been incredible, like a lead character all its own. “You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t stop it from throwing itself violently out of an airlock.” “You can with the most basic horse harness.” “Why do I keep thinking I’m clever? I’m not. On a good day, I’m barely not stupid!” I’m all for Captain Clark’s existential reckoning with his own intelligence, but I draw the line at shaving his beard. As does Judd: “Beardedness is actually in your contract.” Thanks for reading along, folks, and just remember — there is beauty to be found in even the turd-iest of poop-orbits.

However, in a time where our world (and, sure, maybe even the galaxy) has been thrust into mass hysteria and people are hoarding toilet paper as though they might soon participate in their own personal turd-orbit … these moments of space-chaos were somehow both funny and poignant. While the Avenue 5 writers couldn’t have known the specific state the world would be in when they wrote this finale, the series has always been about the ways in which people begin panicking in the face of impending disaster, while simultaneously denying the reality of their own doom, making it worse through their own selfishness, and ignoring the few people who actually know what they’re talking about. And tonight, that funhouse mirror just slid right into place, didn’t it?! To quote Captain Clark, the fake captain of a luxury spaceship orbited by human feces whose only value is his fingerprints: “We just watched seven people stupid themselves to death.” Ever the agent of chaos, Matt has changed the code to the airlocks and hidden himself somewhere in the ship so as not to cause any more harm after watching seven people happily march to their space-deaths with the code he gave them last week. The other assembled main characters briefly believe that Matt’s message means he’s gone to kill himself and flood his inbox with messages encouraging him not to do that after Captain Clark first sends him a bracelet-butt-dial voice recording that says, “Life without you would be,” looooong pause, “the only word I could think of was easier!” And everyone else’s overlapping messages are just as in line with their own personalities including, “Hey Matt, it’s Judd from work … you’re the son I never had, the lover I never wanted,” and capped off perfectly by Iris: “Matt, those people were fucking idiots, we’re better off with them, now give us the goddamn codes.” Billie makes the startling announcement that if they don’t get the airlock code to jettison the excess weight off of the ship within the hour, they’ll be stuck with the original three and a half year trajectory. Not to mention, as Cyrus notes, they need that code to retrieve Captain Joe’s hands and head to take control of the ship’s steering for their emergency docking since Captain Clark stands no chance of being able to do it himself. So everyone splits up to search for Matt while Karen and Iris — a formidable duo if ever there was one — are tasked with ramping up the donations for jettisoning. And that formidable duo becomes a terrifying trio as Rav finally makes her way onboard and finds out from the passengers dragging their guitars and dumbbells to be thrown off the ship that seven humans also recently decided to throw themselves off. “Is that it — just a simple ‘Rav?!'” Rav screams when Iris calmly greets her while dragging a giant golden horse out of Judd’s cabin. “See, I was expecting something more along the lines of, uh, ‘Sorry for surrounding our groundbreaking luxury cruise liner with s— and corpses.'” But this is a luxury poop-and-cadaver cruise of everyone’s making, not just Iris. Or, as Matt informs Judd and Captain Clark while they roam the lower deck of the ship screaming his name in a high-pitched voice and find him casually getting a candy bar from the vending machines: “Well … we’re all hiding.” And while Matt has been hiding and plunging the ship into chaos once more, he’s been carefully itemizing his thoughts. Though 309: “Every year we pass the pre-anniversary of our death, but we don’t even know it, so we don’t get presents.” And thought 14: “Poor octopus — eight arms, but no hands. F— you, God!” And like the eight handless arms of the hopeless being that they are, the whole gang suddenly converges at Matt’s non-hiding spot. They all demand that he give them the code, but Matt doesn’t give it up until Rav threatens physical violence after just proving her merit by backhanding Judd to Jupiter. The code is 0-0-0-5 for Avenue 5: “I made it so that anyone thinking rationally would be able to guess it, and anyone thinking irrationally, anyone suicidal, would not.” Judd, thinking only of himself, sprints away toward the supply shuttle to catch his ride back to Earth, and everyone races after him. Karen is busy threatening to take people’s teeth if they don’t get their final jettisoning items to her, but she soon also joins the gang, just in time to see Judd board the supply ship. Judd demands that the pilot “go, go go!” but the pilot tells him it doesn’t work that way; he’s just there to press two buttons at the right time and the rest is automated. So in the meantime, Jordan the comedian asks Judd through the speaker system why he would want to go back to Earth since everyone hates him there on account of that time when Judd contemplated mass murder. And when Judd comes bustling off the ship, Jordan sprints onboard before anyone knows what’s happened. “Jordan, I did like you, but I am very, very weird!” Billie yells at him, correctly. After the pilot deboards to change his travel catheter, Doug grabs Mia’s hand in an act of passion, and rushes on board the supply ship, wrestling Jordan out of there and claiming the two seats as their own… Until Cyrus returns from his mission outside with Captain Joe’s head and hands (all of which have exploded beyond use), and Captain Clark goes absolutely nuts, his British accent raising to a decibel we’ve yet to hear. “That’s it!” he screams as he rushes on the supply ship. “My patience has snapped like a 100-year-old breadstick! I am the captain still, and I decide who stays and who goes!” And even though he wasn’t asking for that person to be him, everyone just sort of decides it should be. “You’re very unhappy,” Matt tells him. “You know that thing you do, where you act sarcastic so we all feel sorry for you? It works — we do.” Everyone raises their hand in an emotional salute as the pilot hits his second button and the ship truly begins its final countdown to whisk Captain Clark back to Earth… Well, everyone except Billie, who stands there with her arms crossed until Captain Clark realizes he has to stay because he’s still the only one who can steer the ship. Captain Clark deboards, Jordan rushes on again, and as the supply ship countdown grows lower, Karen also starts the countdown for the jettison.

Let’s start with the latter story: Nia’s roommate Yvette insists that Nia not spend another night “crying over that weird little man” (ha!) and instead come out with her to meet her new boyfriend Angus, whom she’s been chatting with on dating app UpSwipes for three weeks. Nia agrees, but at the club, she has a vision that she can’t interpret while Yvette is lured to the alley by a text from Angus. But Angus isn’t Angus; he’s a predatory bigot who attacks her and gives her a message for Dreamer: “The world doesn’t want a trans superhero.” He warns that if Dreamer doesn’t stop her superheroics, he’ll keep attacking the trans community. It’s ugly and awful, and although a National City detective promises to do his best to find the attacker, Nia wants to put an end to the man who hurt and humiliated her roommate herself. But Kara urges her to let the police and Supergirl bring him to justice. “There is no hope speech that can make this better,” Nia tells Kara, but she reluctantly agrees to give law enforcement a few hours to make the arrest. After her ordeal, Yvette begins deleting all of her social media, tired of making herself a target as a trans woman of color. Nia urges her not to. “They want us to be invisible because of their own fears. They want to erase us, so we need to shine even brighter.” Then Nia moves forward with her own plans, setting up a profile on UpSwipes to lure out the attacker. Kara, meanwhile, enlists the help of Brainy, who’s morosely watching footage of Dreamer taking down a Dominator. He pushes aside his feelings and agrees to help. Then Kara helps William with his story on Yvette’s attack. They discuss just how often violence against the transgender community is misreported or underreported, often because the victims are misgendered in police reports, which gives her a glimpse at what’s driving Nia’s quest for justice. (All true, by the way, and kudos to this episode for highlighting these statistics this for viewers who may not be aware.) Nia’s gambit pays off, and she arrives at an UpSwipes meetup as Dreamer, where she confronts Yvette’s attacker. He pulls a knife on her and spews all kinds of vile hate. Dreamer has him lassoed around the neck when Supergirl shows up, having been alerted by Brainy about Nia’s dating profile. Despite Nia’s earlier warning, Supergirl gives her a hope speech: don’t stoop to this man’s level; she, Alex, J’onn, and Brainy will help keep Nia’s community safe now that they’re more aware of the dangers they face. And with that, Dreamer lets Supergirl make the arrest, although not before threatening the man if he returns to his hate crimes after he’s released from prison. At CatCo later that night, Kara finds Nia crying on the balcony. She’s overwhelmed and upset at how badly she wanted to murder the attacker. Also, she couldn’t interpret her dream just like she couldn’t save her mother’s life, and she’s still heartbroken that the one person who supported and loved her ended their relationship without an explanation. Kara apologizes for not considering Nia’s lived experiences but reiterates that not lashing out with violence against the bad guys is what separates them from the bad guys. Also, Brainy worked his mojo and found the attacker’s online hate group, which he hands over to the detective on the case. “The DEO takes threats against our sister superheroes very seriously,” says an emotionless Brainy. Give us back our old Brainy soon, please! The other half of this episode starts two months ago, when a mean-eyed man watches a happy couple hop into a sled pulled by a white tiger (goals!) in a North Pole VR setting, then get stuck inside when the end-simulation function glitches. Kelly pulls him out and reports the failsafe glitch. We then jump ahead to today, when Al from the alien bar asks J’onn and Alex for help finding his brother, who checked into a hotel a week ago for a weekend escape experience at Obsidian Platinum’s Virtual Las Vegas. While J’onn searches for Trevor’s physical person, Alex puts on the lenses and searches for him virtually with a real-world link to Kelly to guide her. In the VR, Alex is greeted with a number of experience options based on her own desires, including one that looks a little like Alex-as-Supergirl and one with her cradling a baby. But she heads to the old-school Vegas simulator and quickly finds a spooky haunted house on a hill, which is thoroughly out of place in the Nevada desert. Kelly explains that this is one of the customized add-ons that Obsidian allows advanced users to create without any regulation or oversight, which … yikes. That seems like a big loophole. Alex walks into the house and finds it set up like the tank where Rick Malverne nearly drowned her. Kelly explains that it’s designed to tap into the user’s worst fears, and worse, the failsafe glitch from a few months ago hasn’t been fixed, so the two men in the tanks have been tortured for days. This could lead to actual brain damage, so Alex uses her new Hand of the Soldier Martian tech, which isn’t cooperating in the real world, to set them free. They confirm that they’re friends of Trevor’s, and he passed through the adjacent wooden door with Richard, a new guy in their group. In the real world, J’onn locates Richard’s wife. She’s the woman who climbed into the sled with Trevor in the North Pole VR, which makes Richard the man who watched in envy. His wife admits to a VR affair with Trevor, and J’onn quickly puts it together that her computer programmer husband Richard created a trap for Trevor. Alas, Alex doesn’t learn any of that because she loses contact with Kelly once she steps through the door and finds Trevor frozen in fear, his whole body lighting up to explode from within before he’s reconfigured to painfully explode again, over and over. When Richard shows up to watch Trevor suffer, Alex shoots him and sends him rocketing out of the simulation. He comes to in his hotel room, eyes disgustingly bloody around the lenses, to be taken into custody by J’onn. In the VR, Alex talks Trevor into shutting down the next explosion and gets him to tell her what hotel he’s checked into so she and J’onn can rescue him in the real world. After everyone’s safe and sound, Kelly and Alex reconvene at the alien bar. Kelly confirms that it shouldn’t have been possible for Alex to eject Richard from the simulation and that the failsafe glitch wasn’t corrected after all. Also, virtual romance is cheating, and virtual torture is real attempted murder. Good to know! Then Trevor shows up to thank Alex in person. This storyline wraps up with an unconscious Richard being wheeled away from his hospital room by Margot, the Leviathan liaison, to be wrapped up like a silver burrito and suspended from the ceiling alongside other silver-wrapped humans. What do you want with these people, Leviathan, and why am I suddenly craving Chipotle? Finally, J’onn encourages Alex to give herself more time with her Hand of the Soldier tech, reminding her that it’ll instinctively bond with her bioelectric pulses if she lets it in. But as they end their training session, Alex gets a call from her mother and heads straight to Kara’s apartment with dreadful news: their father Jeremiah is dead. Snaps of the cape Nicole Maines killed it this week as Nia. Thank you for telling a too-often overlooked story about a too-often overlooked community, Supergirl. Despite the important message this week, this episode did reveal a growing crack in the season: with Alex not at the DEO, her storylines are starting to feel disconnected to the Supergirl storylines. Here’s hoping those can be stitched together more closely in future episodes. Woof, that Kara/William date was … rough. Sure, she was nervous after two and a half years off the market, but that was incredibly awkward, no?

Or, as Matt informs Judd and Captain Clark while they roam the lower deck of the ship screaming his name in a high-pitched voice and find him casually getting a candy bar from the vending machines: “Well … we’re all hiding.” And while Matt has been hiding and plunging the ship into chaos once more, he’s been carefully itemizing his thoughts. Though 309: “Every year we pass the pre-anniversary of our death, but we don’t even know it, so we don’t get presents.” And thought 14: “Poor octopus — eight arms, but no hands. F— you, God!” And like the eight handless arms of the hopeless being that they are, the whole gang suddenly converges at Matt’s non-hiding spot. They all demand that he give them the code, but Matt doesn’t give it up until Rav threatens physical violence after just proving her merit by backhanding Judd to Jupiter. The code is 0-0-0-5 for Avenue 5: “I made it so that anyone thinking rationally would be able to guess it, and anyone thinking irrationally, anyone suicidal, would not.” Judd, thinking only of himself, sprints away toward the supply shuttle to catch his ride back to Earth, and everyone races after him. Karen is busy threatening to take people’s teeth if they don’t get their final jettisoning items to her, but she soon also joins the gang, just in time to see Judd board the supply ship. Judd demands that the pilot “go, go go!” but the pilot tells him it doesn’t work that way; he’s just there to press two buttons at the right time and the rest is automated. So in the meantime, Jordan the comedian asks Judd through the speaker system why he would want to go back to Earth since everyone hates him there on account of that time when Judd contemplated mass murder. And when Judd comes bustling off the ship, Jordan sprints onboard before anyone knows what’s happened. “Jordan, I did like you, but I am very, very weird!” Billie yells at him, correctly. After the pilot deboards to change his travel catheter, Doug grabs Mia’s hand in an act of passion, and rushes on board the supply ship, wrestling Jordan out of there and claiming the two seats as their own… Until Cyrus returns from his mission outside with Captain Joe’s head and hands (all of which have exploded beyond use), and Captain Clark goes absolutely nuts, his British accent raising to a decibel we’ve yet to hear. “That’s it!” he screams as he rushes on the supply ship. “My patience has snapped like a 100-year-old breadstick! I am the captain still, and I decide who stays and who goes!” And even though he wasn’t asking for that person to be him, everyone just sort of decides it should be. “You’re very unhappy,” Matt tells him. “You know that thing you do, where you act sarcastic so we all feel sorry for you? It works — we do.” Everyone raises their hand in an emotional salute as the pilot hits his second button and the ship truly begins its final countdown to whisk Captain Clark back to Earth… Well, everyone except Billie, who stands there with her arms crossed until Captain Clark realizes he has to stay because he’s still the only one who can steer the ship. Captain Clark deboards, Jordan rushes on again, and as the supply ship countdown grows lower, Karen also starts the countdown for the jettison. She’s gathered enough items, and they’ll make it just under the hour that Billie forewarned. And as two clashing countdowns, both in Judd’s voice, play at once, that familiar feeling of chaos begins to descend: “This is like psychosis but with none of the advantages!” Iris now rushes on board the supply ship to physically remove Jordan so that Mr. Judd can come on board as was the original plan. And while Judd is refusing because he doesn’t want to go back to Earth where he’s hated, the countdown for the jettison completes, and the ship shakes as the items weighing as much as 500 people are launched into space. “We just jettisoned from the portside airlocks, we’re gonna be home in six months baby,” Karen proudly announces. “You jettisoned out of the rear, not the portside” Billie corrects, as Billie is wont to do. But Karen meant what she said. Captain Clark begin screaming at Karen that the whole point was to launch the weight out of the back of the ship to propel them forward. “You’ve gotta s— out of the back of the ship — this is basic s—ing!” As everyone yells that even babies know how to s— correctly, Karen crumbles realizing her mistake — “I feel like I’m dying and my teeth are falling off!” — demanding that Frank do something worse to take the attention off of her. But nothing could be worse than what Karen has done. Cyrus announces that their new earliest trajectory for a potential rescue is… “Eight years?!” Matt yells. “That’s longer than the Beatles were together; that’s longer than the Seven Years’ War!” And with that, the doors to the supply shuttle slam shut with Iris still inside, and Judd still on the ship screaming her name. “Do you think she can hear me?” he asks Captain Clark. A FEW SPACE NUGGETS: No, but you may as well keep screaming, indeed, folks! This is the last chance to mention it, so I should mention it: the score of Avenue 5 has been incredible, like a lead character all its own. “You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t stop it from throwing itself violently out of an airlock.” “You can with the most basic horse harness.” “Why do I keep thinking I’m clever? I’m not. On a good day, I’m barely not stupid!” I’m all for Captain Clark’s existential reckoning with his own intelligence, but I draw the line at shaving his beard. As does Judd: “Beardedness is actually in your contract.” Thanks for reading along, folks, and just remember — there is beauty to be found in even the turd-iest of poop-orbits.

Let’s start with the latter story: Nia’s roommate Yvette insists that Nia not spend another night “crying over that weird little man” (ha!) and instead come out with her to meet her new boyfriend Angus, whom she’s been chatting with on dating app UpSwipes for three weeks. Nia agrees, but at the club, she has a vision that she can’t interpret while Yvette is lured to the alley by a text from Angus. But Angus isn’t Angus; he’s a predatory bigot who attacks her and gives her a message for Dreamer: “The world doesn’t want a trans superhero.” He warns that if Dreamer doesn’t stop her superheroics, he’ll keep attacking the trans community. It’s ugly and awful, and although a National City detective promises to do his best to find the attacker, Nia wants to put an end to the man who hurt and humiliated her roommate herself. But Kara urges her to let the police and Supergirl bring him to justice. “There is no hope speech that can make this better,” Nia tells Kara, but she reluctantly agrees to give law enforcement a few hours to make the arrest. After her ordeal, Yvette begins deleting all of her social media, tired of making herself a target as a trans woman of color. Nia urges her not to. “They want us to be invisible because of their own fears. They want to erase us, so we need to shine even brighter.” Then Nia moves forward with her own plans, setting up a profile on UpSwipes to lure out the attacker. Kara, meanwhile, enlists the help of Brainy, who’s morosely watching footage of Dreamer taking down a Dominator. He pushes aside his feelings and agrees to help. Then Kara helps William with his story on Yvette’s attack. They discuss just how often violence against the transgender community is misreported or underreported, often because the victims are misgendered in police reports, which gives her a glimpse at what’s driving Nia’s quest for justice. (All true, by the way, and kudos to this episode for highlighting these statistics this for viewers who may not be aware.) Nia’s gambit pays off, and she arrives at an UpSwipes meetup as Dreamer, where she confronts Yvette’s attacker. He pulls a knife on her and spews all kinds of vile hate. Dreamer has him lassoed around the neck when Supergirl shows up, having been alerted by Brainy about Nia’s dating profile. Despite Nia’s earlier warning, Supergirl gives her a hope speech: don’t stoop to this man’s level; she, Alex, J’onn, and Brainy will help keep Nia’s community safe now that they’re more aware of the dangers they face. And with that, Dreamer lets Supergirl make the arrest, although not before threatening the man if he returns to his hate crimes after he’s released from prison. At CatCo later that night, Kara finds Nia crying on the balcony. She’s overwhelmed and upset at how badly she wanted to murder the attacker. Also, she couldn’t interpret her dream just like she couldn’t save her mother’s life, and she’s still heartbroken that the one person who supported and loved her ended their relationship without an explanation. Kara apologizes for not considering Nia’s lived experiences but reiterates that not lashing out with violence against the bad guys is what separates them from the bad guys. Also, Brainy worked his mojo and found the attacker’s online hate group, which he hands over to the detective on the case. “The DEO takes threats against our sister superheroes very seriously,” says an emotionless Brainy. Give us back our old Brainy soon, please! The other half of this episode starts two months ago, when a mean-eyed man watches a happy couple hop into a sled pulled by a white tiger (goals!) in a North Pole VR setting, then get stuck inside when the end-simulation function glitches. Kelly pulls him out and reports the failsafe glitch. We then jump ahead to today, when Al from the alien bar asks J’onn and Alex for help finding his brother, who checked into a hotel a week ago for a weekend escape experience at Obsidian Platinum’s Virtual Las Vegas. While J’onn searches for Trevor’s physical person, Alex puts on the lenses and searches for him virtually with a real-world link to Kelly to guide her. In the VR, Alex is greeted with a number of experience options based on her own desires, including one that looks a little like Alex-as-Supergirl and one with her cradling a baby. But she heads to the old-school Vegas simulator and quickly finds a spooky haunted house on a hill, which is thoroughly out of place in the Nevada desert. Kelly explains that this is one of the customized add-ons that Obsidian allows advanced users to create without any regulation or oversight, which … yikes. That seems like a big loophole. Alex walks into the house and finds it set up like the tank where Rick Malverne nearly drowned her. Kelly explains that it’s designed to tap into the user’s worst fears, and worse, the failsafe glitch from a few months ago hasn’t been fixed, so the two men in the tanks have been tortured for days. This could lead to actual brain damage, so Alex uses her new Hand of the Soldier Martian tech, which isn’t cooperating in the real world, to set them free. They confirm that they’re friends of Trevor’s, and he passed through the adjacent wooden door with Richard, a new guy in their group. In the real world, J’onn locates Richard’s wife. She’s the woman who climbed into the sled with Trevor in the North Pole VR, which makes Richard the man who watched in envy. His wife admits to a VR affair with Trevor, and J’onn quickly puts it together that her computer programmer husband Richard created a trap for Trevor. Alas, Alex doesn’t learn any of that because she loses contact with Kelly once she steps through the door and finds Trevor frozen in fear, his whole body lighting up to explode from within before he’s reconfigured to painfully explode again, over and over. When Richard shows up to watch Trevor suffer, Alex shoots him and sends him rocketing out of the simulation. He comes to in his hotel room, eyes disgustingly bloody around the lenses, to be taken into custody by J’onn. In the VR, Alex talks Trevor into shutting down the next explosion and gets him to tell her what hotel he’s checked into so she and J’onn can rescue him in the real world. After everyone’s safe and sound, Kelly and Alex reconvene at the alien bar. Kelly confirms that it shouldn’t have been possible for Alex to eject Richard from the simulation and that the failsafe glitch wasn’t corrected after all. Also, virtual romance is cheating, and virtual torture is real attempted murder. Good to know! Then Trevor shows up to thank Alex in person. This storyline wraps up with an unconscious Richard being wheeled away from his hospital room by Margot, the Leviathan liaison, to be wrapped up like a silver burrito and suspended from the ceiling alongside other silver-wrapped humans. What do you want with these people, Leviathan, and why am I suddenly craving Chipotle? Finally, J’onn encourages Alex to give herself more time with her Hand of the Soldier tech, reminding her that it’ll instinctively bond with her bioelectric pulses if she lets it in. But as they end their training session, Alex gets a call from her mother and heads straight to Kara’s apartment with dreadful news: their father Jeremiah is dead. Snaps of the cape Nicole Maines killed it this week as Nia. Thank you for telling a too-often overlooked story about a too-often overlooked community, Supergirl. Despite the important message this week, this episode did reveal a growing crack in the season: with Alex not at the DEO, her storylines are starting to feel disconnected to the Supergirl storylines. Here’s hoping those can be stitched together more closely in future episodes. Woof, that Kara/William date was … rough. Sure, she was nervous after two and a half years off the market, but that was incredibly awkward, no?

However, in a time where our world (and, sure, maybe even the galaxy) has been thrust into mass hysteria and people are hoarding toilet paper as though they might soon participate in their own personal turd-orbit … these moments of space-chaos were somehow both funny and poignant. While the Avenue 5 writers couldn’t have known the specific state the world would be in when they wrote this finale, the series has always been about the ways in which people begin panicking in the face of impending disaster, while simultaneously denying the reality of their own doom, making it worse through their own selfishness, and ignoring the few people who actually know what they’re talking about. And tonight, that funhouse mirror just slid right into place, didn’t it?! To quote Captain Clark, the fake captain of a luxury spaceship orbited by human feces whose only value is his fingerprints: “We just watched seven people stupid themselves to death.” Ever the agent of chaos, Matt has changed the code to the airlocks and hidden himself somewhere in the ship so as not to cause any more harm after watching seven people happily march to their space-deaths with the code he gave them last week. The other assembled main characters briefly believe that Matt’s message means he’s gone to kill himself and flood his inbox with messages encouraging him not to do that after Captain Clark first sends him a bracelet-butt-dial voice recording that says, “Life without you would be,” looooong pause, “the only word I could think of was easier!” And everyone else’s overlapping messages are just as in line with their own personalities including, “Hey Matt, it’s Judd from work … you’re the son I never had, the lover I never wanted,” and capped off perfectly by Iris: “Matt, those people were fucking idiots, we’re better off with them, now give us the goddamn codes.” Billie makes the startling announcement that if they don’t get the airlock code to jettison the excess weight off of the ship within the hour, they’ll be stuck with the original three and a half year trajectory. Not to mention, as Cyrus notes, they need that code to retrieve Captain Joe’s hands and head to take control of the ship’s steering for their emergency docking since Captain Clark stands no chance of being able to do it himself. So everyone splits up to search for Matt while Karen and Iris — a formidable duo if ever there was one — are tasked with ramping up the donations for jettisoning. And that formidable duo becomes a terrifying trio as Rav finally makes her way onboard and finds out from the passengers dragging their guitars and dumbbells to be thrown off the ship that seven humans also recently decided to throw themselves off. “Is that it — just a simple ‘Rav?!'” Rav screams when Iris calmly greets her while dragging a giant golden horse out of Judd’s cabin. “See, I was expecting something more along the lines of, uh, ‘Sorry for surrounding our groundbreaking luxury cruise liner with s— and corpses.'” But this is a luxury poop-and-cadaver cruise of everyone’s making, not just Iris. Or, as Matt informs Judd and Captain Clark while they roam the lower deck of the ship screaming his name in a high-pitched voice and find him casually getting a candy bar from the vending machines: “Well … we’re all hiding.” And while Matt has been hiding and plunging the ship into chaos once more, he’s been carefully itemizing his thoughts. Though 309: “Every year we pass the pre-anniversary of our death, but we don’t even know it, so we don’t get presents.” And thought 14: “Poor octopus — eight arms, but no hands. F— you, God!” And like the eight handless arms of the hopeless being that they are, the whole gang suddenly converges at Matt’s non-hiding spot. They all demand that he give them the code, but Matt doesn’t give it up until Rav threatens physical violence after just proving her merit by backhanding Judd to Jupiter. The code is 0-0-0-5 for Avenue 5: “I made it so that anyone thinking rationally would be able to guess it, and anyone thinking irrationally, anyone suicidal, would not.” Judd, thinking only of himself, sprints away toward the supply shuttle to catch his ride back to Earth, and everyone races after him.

I am the captain still, and I decide who stays and who goes!” And even though he wasn’t asking for that person to be him, everyone just sort of decides it should be. “You’re very unhappy,” Matt tells him. “You know that thing you do, where you act sarcastic so we all feel sorry for you?

Definitely encourage a read.\n\n\\- It was a return to the kind of exposure therapy Pullman had started at around the age of 12. At school, a teacher noticed Pullman spitting into napkins and litter bins. She didn’t know that he was doing the rituals because he believed that he was harboring bad thoughts in his saliva. If he were to swallow before cleansing his palate, he felt something bad would happen to someone he loved.\n\nThe school alerted Pullman’s mother to his behavior, and a doctor diagnosed him with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Pullman began seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist who put him through a series of exposure exercises. “I’m going to drive home after our session, and I’m going to crash my car and die,” the analyst might say. “Don’t perform any of your rituals until I text you that I made it home.”\n\nIn the decades since, therapy like this has helped quiet the voice in Pullman’s head. But it hasn’t eradicated it.\n\n\\- His unexpected candor about his mental health prompts me to reveal that I, too, have struggled with OCD. We begin comparing notes on the specificity of our particular rituals—I excessively wash my hands, he avoids certain numbers—and how it’s hard to stop them until your brain tells you it “feels right.”\n\n”I’ve done something probably 100 times that you probably haven’t noticed,” he says, explaining how he’s been looking to the right of a pillar in his line of sight, swallowing and then shifting his vision to the left. (He’s right; I hadn’t noticed.) It’s a weird thing to bond over, but Pullman invites my vulnerability with his own.\n\n\\- **As a boy,** **Pullman wasn’t interested in becoming an actor.** He liked to drum and paint. When he was nine, he visited his dad on the set of 2002’s *Igby Goes Down*, but inadvertently arrived when his father was shooting a scene that required him to shatter a glass wall and sob in a pool of blood. “After that, Mom was like, ‘Yeah, we’re not doing this,’” he says.\n\n\\- Moving forward, Pullman says, his aim is to forge a career that is a mix of this type of “real guerrilla warfare, in the trenches” indie work, and larger tentpole films. (He just shot a 60-second Michelob Ultra commercial with Kurt Russell, which will air during the Super Bowl and paid him “way, way more” than *Ann Lee*.) It’s the kind of balance his dad has been able to maintain over the years, oscillating between summer hits like *Independence Day* and [David Lynch’s](https://www.gq.com/story/david-lynch-tells-gq-his-secrets-to-happiness) *Lost Highway*. The two of them just spent three months in Australia working together for the first time on a sequel to *Spaceballs*, the Mel Brooks comedy that Pullman senior was part of in 1987.\n\n“I was nervous—not for any reasons that were warranted, but a son is so attuned to every micro-expression of his father, and it’s really hard to turn those instincts off and be the character,” says the younger Pullman. “If he’s judging me, I never hear it. He’s always led with love and encouragement. One of the main ways that I benefit from nepotism is that I was so wholly supported in this endeavor.”", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qtzb1b", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "Optimal-Shoulder-186", "score": 27, "comments": 19, "created_utc": 1770048770.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770066943, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "5dbce9feb90ed83b59c418cc61f88e58aa74a7a8", "source": "reddit", "title": "An emotional Bad Bunny hugs Harry Styles after he won Album of the Year at the 2026 Grammys", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qtz7fm", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "storminthedark", "score": 794, "comments": 43, "created_utc": 1770048554.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770066943, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "cba2745c05a03efc93c4a55e706d06fe8807daf8", "source": "reddit", "title": "Kristen Stewart Says She Chose to Come Out in 2017 Because She Didn't Want to 'Live a Partial Life'", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qtyuig", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "mcfw31", "score": 29, "comments": 2, "created_utc": 1770047801.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770066943, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "9c1019642a1884cf752cfb7fd7ca2acc0675c76e", "source": "reddit", "title": "Alex Warren acknowledges pitchy Grammys performance in new TikTok", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qtytp7", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "monster_ahhh", "score": 803, "comments": 131, "created_utc": 1770047754.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770066943, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "a42fb1dd64709cfdc71040fb3c3c82b89e845950", "source": "reddit", "title": "Katseye's Megan cheering on Katseye from the audience at the Grammys", "body": "for [reference](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1qae57u/laufey_corrects_photographers_at_the_golden/)", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu7i5c", "subreddit": "Fauxmoi", "author": "demimonde9", "score": 8, "comments": 4, "created_utc": 1770065981.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770066944, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "11e222ac423894bfc995fb89347c9d12a40f3c2e", "source": "reddit", "title": "This is so worrisome.. hope she can heal", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu6cux", "subreddit": "Fauxmoi", "author": "ingrid00", "score": 18, "comments": 14, "created_utc": 1770063509.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770066944, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "300e059b802a1f3c439df83db5bc93253b8a6337", "source": "reddit", "title": "Margot Robbie in custom Chanel by Matthieu Blazy at the \"Wuthering Heights\" premiere in Paris.

She could come off as a bit nuts, but that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing in the age of Trump. One person close to Mace recalled the way Bill Maher described meeting Trump for the first time. In this person’s experience, Mace was not a crazy person but someone who played one on TV.\n\n&gt;Five years in, however, it’s unclear if Mace actually knows the difference between the two, according to former staffers. “We’ve moved past that now,” the person said. “Something’s broken. The motherboard’s fried. We’re short-circuiting somewhere.”\n\n&gt; Back then she came across as a breath of fresh air, according to a former staffer. “And then I got into the office, and after six months I was like, ‘Man, this is one of the worst people I’ve ever met. I’m going to move back to South Carolina.’”\n\n&gt;Her antics were a problem well before airportgate. During her first term, staffers say Mace would command them to bring her liquor after midnight to keep parties going at her home, which is technically an abuse of her office according to House rules. “Look, when I worked for her, our poor scheduler was getting calls at two o’clock in the morning to come bring her bottles of tequila,” a former staffer claimed of incidents they recalled going back to 2021.\n\n&gt;When they weren’t buying booze for her, they were doing her housework, according to former staffers. They say she made her aides clean multiple properties she was renting out on Airbnb instead of paying for a maid. On Election Night in 2022, for example, Mace instructed aides to spiff up her $3.9 million home in Isle of Palms for a watch party, according to a former staffer with direct knowledge. She would routinely do the same when she rented out her Washington townhouse, according to the same source and other Mace alumni I spoke to, including another former staffer assigned to do the cleaning.\n\n&gt;She was obsessed with monitoring her reputation online. In addition to reportedly having her staff create burner accounts to defend her, Mace allegedly instructed a staffer to go on Reddit forums about the “hottest women in Congress” to boost her standing in the rankings and comment where needed. Mace was “very adamant” about getting the staffer to upvote any posts about the congresswoman and her attractiveness, according to a second former staffer.\n\n&gt;“We were scared of her,” said one of the former aides. “She would make staffers cry. She would threaten to fire them, take their money away, not give them raises, not to give them days off, religious days.” Intimacy only exacerbated the situation. “The closer you get to her, the harder she messes up your brain,” a different former staffer said. “It’s a classic story of ‘never meet your heroes.’”\n\n&gt;One of them recalled dealing with a befuddled Mace on a 2022 trip to Europe, when they say she wanted to fire an aide for telling reporters she was out of the country, claiming it endangered operational security and amounted to “doxxing” her.

Hidden beneath the phenomenal performances from Jesse Plemmons and Emma Stone that had me on the edge of my seat **fully** convinced that I was watching a bonafide  psychological thriller not unlike many other movies I have seen in the past; 10 Cloverfield Lane came to mind as an influence and I was constantly comparing Goodman's performance to Plemmons. I was expecting another run of the mill intricate game of cat and mouse between a raving lunatic and their innocent captured prey. Some of the scenes were so visceral and intense that I completely forgot the film I had chosen was classified as 'black comedy'.  \n\nLike a lot of you, it wasn't until very near the end of the movie when the full scope of the trick that had been played on the audience (and myself) became apparent. All at once, it dawned on me that this masterpiece of a film was the comedy equivalent of the sixth sense. The entire time, in retrospect, it is blatantly and unabashedly a comedy. The police officer continuously and intentionally bringing up his past **molesting** Teddy, the 'would be heroes' chemically castrating themselves, the 'over the top' gore in some of the scenes, the bumbling and inept abduction scene, the comically bad special effects when Teddy's vest explodes, even the font that the movie uses is foreshadowing the end...the movie was screaming absurdities from the rooftop the entire time - it's entire premise is hilarious at its surface level, but the actors trick you and push their performances so far it blinds you to the fact that a very very funny story is unfolding before your eyes.  \n\nI can't wait for my second watch through, I'll enjoy looking for all the other extremely blatant clues that I ignored or missed. It's so rare that a movie has the kind of rewatch value that Bugonia does and the fact I get to enjoy the ride twice in completely different ways really speaks to how well the vision of the film was executed.  \n\nBravo.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu4lyf", "subreddit": "movies", "author": "Nillows", "score": 86, "comments": 53, "created_utc": 1770059788.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770066958, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "70be7a85e81b949332560484085ff005da2e662b", "source": "reddit", "title": "In need of movie recommendation for my birthday!", "body": "Hello!\n\nI am planning to go to the movies with some friends for my birthday, and I would like to watch a good movie that's on the screen for the 15th february. \n\nInitially, I was planning on watching Iron Lung from Markiplier, but after seeing the reviews, I feel a bit discouraged, also that I wouldnt like to watch an slow burn horror for my BD necesarily. \n\nOther options I was looking at were:\n\n\\- All you need is kill (which may not be on theathers by then)\n\n\\- Scarlet (I really liked the premise but Japan and other fans are slashing this movie atm..)\n\nIm based in Canada.

Art is a continuous conversation, and the idea that a story is closed once it achieves classic status prevents the evolution of storytelling.\n\nThroughout human history, we have retold myths, plays, and folk tales for centuries; just because a movie was successful decades ago does not mean the concept is closed off forever. The popular argument that modern creators have run out of ideas conveniently ignores the fact that many pillars of cinema are themselves reinterpretations. Iconic films like John Carpenter’s The Thing and Brian De Palma’s Scarface are remakes that are now considered more culturally significant than their predecessors. Similarly, many of the greatest Westerns were simply samurai movies adapted for a different setting. \n\nIf we had banned the practice of remaking perfect stories forty years ago, we would have missed out on some of the most celebrated cinema in history. Art is not a static object; it is an evolving dialogue between the past and the present. As technology changes, social perspectives shift, and storytelling techniques improve, a reimagining allows a creator to explore a fresh lens that the original may have missed. \n\nA remake does not subtract from the original work, as the earlier version remains unchanged and accessible. Instead, reboots offer a productive risk / reward scenario where a successful hit provides a brand new way to experience a beloved story, while a failure is simply forgotten. We should prioritize a creative culture that continues to take risks over one that is paralyzed by nostalgia.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu3404", "subreddit": "movies", "author": "jakeseditbay", "score": 0, "comments": 21, "created_utc": 1770056695.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770066959, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "a6692b4d1e6b75fa09edb75e68f19ab4c89a51af", "source": "reddit", "title": "Early April Fools Joke.

These aren’t anything to bat an eye at either, there are some truly heartbreaking stories tonight and some talent that feels like, dare I say, “Top 10 material.” Who am I, Katy Perry? Let’s take a look at which hopefuls make it through to the next round: Robert Taylor, 27, Donaldsonville, La.“Bruises” by Lewis CapaldiRight out of the gate and Idol has me crying already? Maybe it’s just spiked anxiety from, you know, life, but wow wow wow am I here for Robert Taylor (you may remember him from Team Christina on Season 8 of The Voice, BTW) to make it on this show. Being here is a big deal for him: He only recently came out, and was disowned by everyone except his dad, who wanted him to audition for Idol, but as his true self. His dad has passed in January. So anyway, we’re all crying. THANKFULLY, Robert crushes his audition. The emotion just pours out of his vocals. Grace Leer, 27, Nashville, Tenn.“Crowded Table” by The Highwomen // “Crazy” by Patsy ClineA comeback kid! Grace was a contestant on the long-forgot American Juniors (Idol for kids) when she was 11, but opted for a normal childhood afterward. Now she is pursuing country music in Nashville and guys, she is very good. She has a classic country voice, complete with a little yodel and that cry that’ll give you goosebumps. Throughout her audition the judges cannot stop smiling – they’ve found a good one. Katy asks Grace to sing a “sad country song” just to hear her voice on it (still great). They love the texture of her voice and that she knows exactly the kind of artist she wants to be. Oh, it’s going to be fun to watch Grace move forward. Franklin Boone, 27, Durham, N.C.“Dreams” by Fleetwood MacI love when Luke Bryan gets all giggly during an audition. He does that here with Franklin, a teacher at the School of Rock, and declares this the “Alejandro moment” of the season. And after Franklin performs a cool, stripped down version of “Dreams,” Lionel gushes: He loves that Franklin’s come in with style in his voice, in his look, and in his attitude – Franklin’s already a complete package. Luke calls him a “first note kind of singer,” meaning that he knew everything he needed to from the moment Franklin opened his mouth. Will Hollywood Week ruin this true artist? Only time will tell – how exciting! Roselyn Carter, 26, Watts, Calif.“Mother Bowed” by The Pilgrim Travelers // “So High” by John LegendHere’s another audition in which one judge is completely moved from the get-go. Roselyn explains that she’s here to set an example for people in her town, to show them there is a way out of the gang violence, as well as to hopefully find a way to continue to provide for her family. Her voice is raw and full of emotion, and I’m so glad Katy has her sing something a little more contemporary, because Roselyn sounds even better on the John Legend song. Lionel tells her that her interpretation of both those songs “knocks out” and they can’t wait to help Roselyn hone her skills as she moves forward in this competition. Megan Knight, 21, Williamston, N.J.“When Your Mind’s Made Up” by Glen HansardIt’s a beautiful day in Washington, D.C. and the judges want to go sunning on a boat. Who are we to deny them this? It’s clearly all so that Katy can force Luke and Lionel into a triple “I’m flying, Jack! I’m flying!” situation and I don’t blame her. The audition on that boat isn’t the most exciting: The judges give Megan a lot of constructive criticism – she’s overplaying her guitar and overusing her vibrato – but eventually hand over a golden ticket. They weren’t about to end this segment with a rejection, were they? Gilberto Rivera, 23, Orlando, Fla.“Proud Mary” by Tina TurnerWell, the judges did say they are looking for some unidentifiable “x-factor” right? Gilberto – a very hairy guy in a sequined tank and thigh high red boots – certainly gives this his all, complete with some classic “Proud Mary” choreography. Gilberto is a decent singer – he hits a lot of runs and can handle the Tina Turner-ness of it all. The judges can see this, but want him to strip away all the gimmicks. His voice should be the real show. The gimmick is too much for Lionel to get over, so he’s a hard ‘no’ but both Katy and Luke want to see what happens when Gilberto drops the act…and waxes his chest, I guess? That’s where we are now, as a show. Gilberto and his red boots earn a golden ticket. Aliana Jester, 18, Tampa, Fla.“Who’s Lovin’ You” by The MiraclesOkay, this is a story. When Aliana was 12, her mother, who was raising her alone, joined a “religion” and when Aliana didn’t want to join and eventually started dating a non-religious person, her mother got so angry she basically locked her in her room. It’s awful and Aliana almost didn’t survive. Finally, she was able to contact her father and he got her out of there. He saved her life. It’s wild. But now she’s here on Idol with her cute emotional support dog, making things happen for herself. Aliana has a big ol’ booming voice. The judges want her to infuse more emotion into her performance, but other than that they are in love. She reminds Lionel of a “young Whitney” and what more of a response do you need than that? Jahzan, 18, Kingston, Jamaica“Warrior” by Demi LovatoIdol is really hitting these big stories hard tonight. Jahzan and her mother fled from Jamaica when she was 15 “for safety” reasons, but says she’s not allowed to expand on it any further than that. Now, she and her mother live in their uncle’s salon in New York and busk for money. Her mother is her hypewoman and they’re both putting all of their hopes for a better life into this audition basket. Jahzan has a crazy unique voice – Katy says it’s a mix of Toni Braxton, Cher, and Shakira, if that helps you at all – but it is definitely unpolished and lacks control. The judges, however, see lots of potential and are moved by her story, so they are willing to help coach her, and so hand her a ticket to Hollywood Week. Jordan Moyes, 25, Provo, Utah“I’m On Fire” by Bruce SpringsteenHey, it’s another artist giving Luke Bryan the giggles. More than that, during Jordan’s audition, Luke leans over to Katy and whispers, “I want to sign him now.” Honestly, he should do that! It’s a way easier path than suffering through rounds and rounds of Idol! Luke is enamored with his skills on the guitar, his delivery, and his vocals. It’s a haunting cover of this Bruce classic. Lionel just says that Jordan is “very, very, very good” which doesn’t sound like a lot, but guys, it’s the way he says it. The judges love Jordan. Demi Rae, 26, San Jose, Calif.“Mad At You” by Noah CyrusDemi Rae is legit sunshine and I am thankful! for! her! First of all, she’s rocking a pink sweatshirt, biker shorts, gems on her eyelids, and some serious hair clips. More important, when she was nine, she wrote down that her dream was to be on American Idol, and even though her home life hasn’t been ideal, she is here, making it happen! Okay, wait, actually most important: SHE CAN SING. Luke is especially impressed by her “perfectly done falsetto runs” and when they all hear that she’s never pursued music because she thinks she doesn’t look the part, they pretty much want to throw things at her. But, like, in a good way – in a she is deserving of pursuing her dream kind of way. She’ll get to do just that in Hollywood. Makayla Brownlee, 17, Wellington, Kan.“Travelin’ Soldier” by the Dixie Chicks“Little Kansas snake hunter, you’re going to Hollywood” is a real sentence that was uttered and not just Luke Bryan playing mad libs. Makayla is a country girl through and through, all the way to her “sweet and sincere” country voice. It’s actually shocking to hear such a delicate, haunting voice come out of Makayla’s mouth, but that’s her, folks! Lionel tells her that her “magic trick” is the natural “country yodel cry” she has, and she should definitely keep picking songs that take advantage of that. Luke warns her that the female country artist contingent is strong this year, so she needs to be prepared, but he believes she can get in there and battle with the best of them. Amber Fiedler, 23, Coeur D’Alene, Idaho“Trust In Me” by Etta JamesAMBER. Amber is 38 weeks pregnant, but as she explains to the judges, she is giving the baby up for adoption. She’s had a tough life – her own mother battled with drugs – and isn’t at all ready to be a parent, so she’s found a family who can give this child a better life. She says it all very matter-of-factly and it is very moving and mature. But can we also talk about her singing? The greatest thing about this audition is that is just gets better and better. She has complete control and confidence in her voice, so she doesn’t mind waiting to really open up and knock our faces off. It’s effortless and “timeless,” Luke says. It’s the perfect way to end the audition rounds. Hey friends, you want to know something great? Now we’re all going to Hollywood! The Hollywood Week promos promise more twists and crying than ever before. That’s something to look forward to, right?

Jackson in an eyepatch. Marvel is headed to Disneyland, with the all-new Avengers Campus set to open in Disney California Adventure Park on July 18. The massive Marvel area is the latest addition to Disney’s ever-growing collection of attractions, coming just a year after the debut of its Star Wars-themed Galaxy’s Edge. And just as that space promised a ticket to an immersive galaxy far, far away, Avengers Campus will welcome visiting recruits into a small corner of the sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe. Last week, EW was among a handful of press outlets invited to tour the still-under-construction Avengers Campus and get the scoop on all things super. The opening is still several months away, and it shows: At the moment, hidden behind fences emblazoned with the Stark Industries logo, you’ll find little more than rough building shells, exposed beams, and scaffolding. But as you tromp through the mud, it’s hard not to imagine a Quinjet perched on top of that building, or Spider-Man swinging from that roof just overhead. This is Disney’s attempt to bring the world of Marvel off the screen, out of the comics, and into the real world. Marvel has had a Disneyland presence before, and as of right now, visitors can already meet heroes like Captain Marvel, Captain America, and Black Panther or ride the already-up-and-running Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout! (which replaced the old Tower of Terror several years ago). But Avengers Campus is something far more ambitious. The goal isn’t just to let you say hi to your favorite heroes; it’s to help you work alongside them and write your own comic-book-worthy origin story. Maybe you’ll help Peter Parker stop a swarm of skittering robots. Maybe you’ll go through the rigorous Dora Milaje training program. And maybe you’ll tap into your mystical side and learn some wizardry from Doctor Strange. This isn’t a top-secret, restricted facility like S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ. Avengers Campus is open to all, and they’re actively looking for new recruits (a.k.a. Disneyland visitors) to join their ranks and prove their heroism. Located where the old A Bug’s Land used to be in California Adventure, Avengers Campus is considerably smaller than Galaxy’s Edge, but it still squeezes in tons of Marvel geekery. The entire space is one cohesive area, divided into distinct zones: The Guardians of the Galaxy are already represented with Taneleer Tivan’s cosmic tower and Mission: Breakout, but there’s also the main Avengers building, a mystical outdoor Sanctum, the high-tech Pym Test Kitchen, and the newly established Worldwide Engineering Brigade, a.k.a. WEB. (During our tour, one Disney Imagineer compared it to a college campus, with several distinct fraternities and sororities.) Here, EW breaks down all the different areas and heroic opportunities, as well as what to expect when Avengers Campus officially opens its doors this summer. Meet your heroes (literally) at Avengers Headquarters Avengers Campus isn’t a meticulous recreation of places we’ve already seen on film; instead, it’s something totally new — and kind of old. The story goes that back in the 1940s, Tony Stark’s father Howard erected a Stark Motors factory here in California, and decades later, everyone’s favorite billionaire-playboy-philanthropist has transformed the site into a place for the Avengers to recruit and train young heroes. (Marvel loves a good acronym, so the “Campus” name stands for Centralized Assembly Mobilized to Prepare, Unite, and Safeguard.) The centerpiece is the massive, shiny headquarters, topped by a gleaming Quinjet. It’s similar in design to the HQ we’ve seen in the films, but this is its own, unique building. “That’s part of the reason why we wanted to create Avengers Campus as a brand-new place in the universe because then it doesn’t matter your level of fandom,” explains Jillian Pagan, staff writer for Walt Disney Imagineering. “You’re all coming in at the same level. You all can explore a brand-new place together.” There are embedded Easter eggs for the diehard fans who can name every Infinity Stone, as well as the newbies who don’t know their Iron Men from their Ant-Men. There will be plenty of heroes on hand, too: Visitors will be able to meet and interact with Iron Man, Spider-Man, Black Widow, Black Panther, Okoye and the Dora Milaje, Ant-Man, Wasp, Doctor Strange, Groot, Gamora, Star-Lord, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Thor, and Loki. A few of the heroes even dressed up specially for the occasion: Marvel Studios head of visual development Ryan Meinerding helped design a new, park-exclusive suit for Spider-Man and new Mark 80 armor for Iron Man. And since every superhero needs a villain, Avengers Campus will mark the debut of Taskmaster, the classic comics foe who’ll be joining the MCU in the upcoming Black Widow movie. The masked menace has a photographic memory and the ability to instantly copy his opponents’ fighting styles, and depending on when you visit, you may witness a dramatic showdown between the Avengers and Taskmaster on the roof of HQ. (Many of the stunts and fights were choreographed by the same fight coordinator team who worked on Black Widow.) “That guy has been bedeviling the Avengers for a really long time,” teases Dan Fields, executive creative director for Disney Parks Live Entertainment. “What a great foe to have to outthink and outfight and outmaneuver when he’s making an incursion here in the campus.” Of course, the presence of certain heroes raises the question: How can Iron Man or Black Widow be here, alive and well, when we last saw them, uh, dramatically kick the bucket in Avengers: Endgame? The answer is the same way Marvel’s been explaining continuity shenanigans in the comics for decades: Blame it on the multiverse! Avengers: Endgame hinges on the idea that you can go back in time and create alternate timelines and universes. Who’s to say that there isn’t another timeline where these particular heroes went west to California and opened Avengers Campus? “We diverge from the films in that we do kind of live in our own version of the multiverse,” Pagan explains. “We have some characters who maybe sadly have died and have sacrificed themselves in one part of the multiverse but are alive and well in our part of the multiverse. But we can still be informed and have that shared history with the events of the films.” Save the day with the Worldwide Engineering Brigade, a.k.a. WEB The Avengers aren’t the only heroic organization on Avengers Campus. One of the old brick buildings from Howard Stark’s automotive factory has been repurposed by the Worldwide Engineering Brigade — fittingly shortened to WEB. This exclusive, Stark-bankrolled club aims to unite some of the world’s brightest young minds and encourage them to invent new technologies. It’s here that young geniuses like Shuri and Peter Parker might dream up their next invention. If the main Avengers building is all shiny and chrome, WEB is considerably rougher around the edges. When we toured the site, it was still unfinished, but there were old Stark logos stenciled on the walls, and the brand-new brick was artificially weathered and cracked, as if it had been baking in the California sun for the last 80 years. WEB is also home to the campus’s main new attraction: an all-ages Spider-Man ride. Officially named “WEB Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure,” the ride lets visitors team up with Peter Parker to — you guessed it — sling webs and have an adventure. At first, riders enter the WEB building as if they’re there to attend an open house and learn more about the engineering team. Peter’s there showing off one of WEB’s recent inventions, a group of small, drone-like Spider-Bots — which immediately proceed to go haywire and start wreaking havoc. It’s up to riders to don 3D glasses, pile into small rotating cars called “WEB Slinger vehicles,” and start shooting some webs of their own to help catch the wayward bots. There are no buttons to press or blasters to shoot; every vehicle is equipped with brand-new motion-tracking tech, so all you have to do is extend your arm, the way Spider-Man does. (The Imagineers promise that it’s one of those things that’s hard to describe but will feel totally intuitive in person — so we’ll see.) “We wanted it to feel not like there was a special device that had these powers, but you had these special powers,” explains executive creative director Brent Strong. “Early on, our goal was: How do we make the interface disappear? How do we make the interface as transparent as possible, so it feels like you’re web-slinging, and not that you’re wielding a web-slinger?” When we visited, the Imagineers were coy about who might be voicing WEB Slinger’s version of Spider-Man, but since then, Disneyland’s announced that Tom Holland will be lending his voice to the ride. (He’s not the only MCU actor to make an appearance in the land, either: The Guardians of the Galaxy and the Collector himself, Benicio del Toro, already pop up during Mission: Breakout.) And although Spider-Man is the main hero hanging around WEB, comics fans might notice a few familiar names around the building. After all, a place like WEB would attract some of Marvel’s youngest and brightest engineering minds, so while you’re waiting in line, look for references to brilliant young comic heroes like Doreen Green (better known as Squirrel Girl) or the 9-year-old Lunella Lafayette (a.k.a. Moon Girl). Master the mystic arts in Doctor Strange’s Sanctum Much of Avengers Campus is all about the tech, but there’s also a place for the magical and unexplained. Hidden off the main path is an overgrown Sanctum, presided over by Doctor Strange himself. This is no Bleecker Street; this is an ancient temple imbued with magic, and many, uh, strange things happen here. For the Imagineers tasked with building it, it’s another example of taking an idea from the comics and films and exploring it in a totally different setting. “We’re not trying to rubber stamp something right out of the film,” explains Heidi Rosendahl, principal color and paint artisan. “We’ve kind of created our own Sanctum here, and an open, airy space — very much a contrast to the others that are brick and mortar-type facilities. Everything’s a little bit ethereal, and nature comes into play. It’s going to be a very beautiful transition between day and night.” Taste the future at the Pym Test Kitchen If visitors are looking for sustenance in between missions, they have a few options. Over by the Collector’s fortress, Taneleer Tivan himself has opened a stand called Terran Treats, which will feature all sorts of strange, alien edibles (like neon-colored churro spirals and cream puffs). Far more familiar will be the Shawarma Palace cart, a nod to the post-credits scene in 2012’s original Avengers movie. According to the Imagineers, Tony and friends couldn’t fathom the idea of heading west without access to their favorite post-Battle-of-New-York fast food joint, so they asked the restaurant’s owner to open a secondary location here on campus. But the main restaurant on campus is superhero-owned and operated. At the Pym Test Kitchen and adjacent Pym Tasting Lab, everything on the menu has been sized up or down using Ant-Man and the Wasp’s tech — think gargantuan candy bars or impossibly large meatballs. Even walking into the Test Kitchen is designed to feel a bit like walking into an enormous Quantum Tunnel, with its sleek, scientific design. Overhead, regular-sized pretzels zoom by on a conveyer belt, until they’re zapped with Pym Particles and emerge three times larger. There will also be plenty of beverage options, both alcoholic and otherwise. And in a nod to the oft-forgotten Incredible Hulk movie, the neon-green soda Pingo Doce will be for sale — hopefully, gamma radiation not included. (Read more about the Avengers Campus food and beverage options here.) All of this will be available when Avengers Campus opens its doors in July, but the Imagineers promise that they’re planning long past this summer. (Disney has previously teased a future interactive Avengers ride, set in Black Panther’s Wakanda.) By working with the Marvel Studios development teams, they’ve planted Easter eggs and references for films and Disney+ TV shows that won’t be released for years. “We always have endless ideas, and thankfully, there’s always more movies, there’s always more comic books,” executive creative director Brent Strong says. “We have more references and inspiration than you could ever hope for, so there’s no shortage of ideas. It’s just a matter of time before they all find their way off the page and into the park.” Related content: —All the Avengers Campus food and beverages, from Pingo Doce to shawarma —Disney unveils new Avengers, Spider-Man rides for Marvel park expansions —Disney to follow Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge theme park expansion with Marvel land", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "ew.com", "priority": 72, "ts": 1770067681, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "c2132f79d5663405b33efda685f9bc7497adfa7f", "source": "reddit", "title": "Margot Robbie Arriving to the French Premiere of \"Wuthering Heights\" in Custom Chanel", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu621x", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "ThrowawayGreenWitch", "score": 44, "comments": 14, "created_utc": 1770062874.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067688, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "a445f046e01528214f3fa73dd98003d6d0efc928", "source": "reddit", "title": "Ricky Gervais calls out 2026 Grammy winners for political speeches", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu5m42", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "bwermer", "score": 0, "comments": 6, "created_utc": 1770061930.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067688, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "4e7a4923227444aed004dd98c407732bd1195ea3", "source": "reddit", "title": "Margot Robbie at the premiere of ‘Wuthering Heights’ in Paris (February 2, 2026)", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu5dcx", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "mcfw31", "score": 38, "comments": 24, "created_utc": 1770061405.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067688, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "12ec4e151490ca66b4aa993e821ab4a065494978", "source": "reddit", "title": "Associate Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and her husband Patrick were in the Grammy audience.\n\nJustice Jackson is up for a Grammy in the \"Best Audio Book\" category, for her memoir \"Lovely One.\"", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu4bdz", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "Conscious-Quarter423", "score": 320, "comments": 7, "created_utc": 1770059178.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067689, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "a289b0c5f8947d3e2bb93b87aaa5aa9062b25667", "source": "reddit", "title": "Willem Dafoe at the Boca Juniors vs Newell's match in Buenos Aires, Argentina (February 1, 2026)", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu3zg0", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "mcfw31", "score": 109, "comments": 10, "created_utc": 1770058498.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067689, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "0587debdc27e83ef85093842d3dc651c59785b49", "source": "reddit", "title": "Harry Styles’ ‘Aperture’ Debuts at No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu3yem", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "mcfw31", "score": 10, "comments": 7, "created_utc": 1770058440.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067689, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "0899d7bc8be9441cfeb471e0feadcb721ff01a60", "source": "reddit", "title": "Grammy Awards: Ten, twenty and thirty years ago", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu39iv", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "emeraldnob", "score": 32, "comments": 5, "created_utc": 1770057017.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067689, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "0abc99fd152936cfb6c8b41fa7f9d80e2dd82d36", "source": "reddit", "title": "Kiernan Shipka for Interview : Industry Confessions by Morgan Maher - February 2, 2026", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu321e", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "Maximum_Expert92", "score": 5, "comments": 5, "created_utc": 1770056580.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067689, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "fd1c59d03a69a49fe0751e0997250470c635b210", "source": "reddit", "title": "Kesha &amp; Justin Bieber in The Grammy Awards in 2010 &amp; 2026.", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu2142", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "PestoBolloElemento", "score": 493, "comments": 49, "created_utc": 1770054484.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067690, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "1e6c9b4167d10e610c49e4dff7b98bee1a6e8904", "source": "reddit", "title": "Keke Palmer Says She 'Never' Wants to Live with a Romantic Partner, Even If They Get Married: 'I Like My Alone Time'", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu1x2o", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "mcfw31", "score": 1326, "comments": 280, "created_utc": 1770054247.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067690, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "0bbe03a03a717dc18bbeb3c8ab01b1b3ccc45440", "source": "reddit", "title": "Glimpse into the set design of Wuthering Heights (courtesy: Arch.

Grammy attendees went further.\"\n\n\"There is also the fact that celebrity enthusiasm for Kamala Harris – from “Kamala is brat”, to Taylor Swift’s “childless cat lady” post, to Megan Thee Stallion’s rally performance in Atlanta, Georgia – now figures prominently in diagnoses of why the campaign was a complete failure.\"", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qtzbf5", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "Glass-News-9184", "score": 50, "comments": 20, "created_utc": 1770048792.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067691, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "a5281cecc480364343f0388371525699eaa921ee", "source": "reddit", "title": "Lewis Pullman on OCD in GQ Magazine - “This little voice that I think is helping me has to go away, and I don’t want it to go away, because it’s saying ‘You can’t survive without me.’”", "body": "Man’s looking way too fine, but the [article](https://www.gq.com/story/lewis-pullman-gq-hype) itself is really interesting. Definitely encourage a read.\n\n\\- It was a return to the kind of exposure therapy Pullman had started at around the age of 12. At school, a teacher noticed Pullman spitting into napkins and litter bins. She didn’t know that he was doing the rituals because he believed that he was harboring bad thoughts in his saliva. If he were to swallow before cleansing his palate, he felt something bad would happen to someone he loved.\n\nThe school alerted Pullman’s mother to his behavior, and a doctor diagnosed him with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Pullman began seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist who put him through a series of exposure exercises. “I’m going to drive home after our session, and I’m going to crash my car and die,” the analyst might say. “Don’t perform any of your rituals until I text you that I made it home.”\n\nIn the decades since, therapy like this has helped quiet the voice in Pullman’s head. But it hasn’t eradicated it.\n\n\\- His unexpected candor about his mental health prompts me to reveal that I, too, have struggled with OCD. We begin comparing notes on the specificity of our particular rituals—I excessively wash my hands, he avoids certain numbers—and how it’s hard to stop them until your brain tells you it “feels right.”\n\n”I’ve done something probably 100 times that you probably haven’t noticed,” he says, explaining how he’s been looking to the right of a pillar in his line of sight, swallowing and then shifting his vision to the left. (He’s right; I hadn’t noticed.) It’s a weird thing to bond over, but Pullman invites my vulnerability with his own.\n\n\\- **As a boy,** **Pullman wasn’t interested in becoming an actor.** He liked to drum and paint. When he was nine, he visited his dad on the set of 2002’s *Igby Goes Down*, but inadvertently arrived when his father was shooting a scene that required him to shatter a glass wall and sob in a pool of blood. “After that, Mom was like, ‘Yeah, we’re not doing this,’” he says.\n\n\\- Moving forward, Pullman says, his aim is to forge a career that is a mix of this type of “real guerrilla warfare, in the trenches” indie work, and larger tentpole films. (He just shot a 60-second Michelob Ultra commercial with Kurt Russell, which will air during the Super Bowl and paid him “way, way more” than *Ann Lee*.) It’s the kind of balance his dad has been able to maintain over the years, oscillating between summer hits like *Independence Day* and [David Lynch’s](https://www.gq.com/story/david-lynch-tells-gq-his-secrets-to-happiness) *Lost Highway*. The two of them just spent three months in Australia working together for the first time on a sequel to *Spaceballs*, the Mel Brooks comedy that Pullman senior was part of in 1987.\n\n“I was nervous—not for any reasons that were warranted, but a son is so attuned to every micro-expression of his father, and it’s really hard to turn those instincts off and be the character,” says the younger Pullman. “If he’s judging me, I never hear it. He’s always led with love and encouragement. One of the main ways that I benefit from nepotism is that I was so wholly supported in this endeavor.”", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qtzb1b", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "Optimal-Shoulder-186", "score": 27, "comments": 19, "created_utc": 1770048770.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067691, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "9e3282cebdbfd6ebb67ab5be05135f923c7ec596", "source": "reddit", "title": "An emotional Bad Bunny hugs Harry Styles after he won Album of the Year at the 2026 Grammys", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qtz7fm", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "storminthedark", "score": 826, "comments": 43, "created_utc": 1770048554.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067692, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "d26779573f611ea2167205ba10f63e2a66147788", "source": "reddit", "title": "Kristen Stewart Says She Chose to Come Out in 2017 Because She Didn't Want to 'Live a Partial Life'", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qtyuig", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "mcfw31", "score": 32, "comments": 2, "created_utc": 1770047801.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067692, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "cd48bd147febab192857953820ac6d7108afd183", "source": "reddit", "title": "Alex Warren acknowledges pitchy Grammys performance in new TikTok", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qtytp7", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "monster_ahhh", "score": 845, "comments": 133, "created_utc": 1770047754.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067692, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "a7d4c19fb75e12a5833bbb51144b0b5c83b0d6fe", "source": "reddit", "title": "Amanda Seyfried's most iconic line", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu7z5v", "subreddit": "Fauxmoi", "author": "demimonde9", "score": 15, "comments": 2, "created_utc": 1770067007.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067692, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "3c1479a0e50b4731bae480d79f7b0a60d2b52cef", "source": "reddit", "title": "Connor Storrie and Francois Arnaud pose to W Magazine", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu7x0h", "subreddit": "Fauxmoi", "author": "strachey", "score": 10, "comments": 1, "created_utc": 1770066874.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067692, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "bcce992409be88b266a22e155c0fb7545bc30a2f", "source": "reddit", "title": "Katseye's Megan cheering on Katseye from the audience at the Grammys", "body": "for [reference](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1qae57u/laufey_corrects_photographers_at_the_golden/)", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu7i5c", "subreddit": "Fauxmoi", "author": "demimonde9", "score": 21, "comments": 6, "created_utc": 1770065981.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067693, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "39fd028857e9ef7ec3a93af9b0d18d055b48ec38", "source": "reddit", "title": "Margot Robbie in custom Chanel by Matthieu Blazy at the \"Wuthering Heights\" premiere in Paris.

She could come off as a bit nuts, but that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing in the age of Trump. One person close to Mace recalled the way Bill Maher described meeting Trump for the first time. In this person’s experience, Mace was not a crazy person but someone who played one on TV.\n\n&gt;Five years in, however, it’s unclear if Mace actually knows the difference between the two, according to former staffers. “We’ve moved past that now,” the person said. “Something’s broken. The motherboard’s fried. We’re short-circuiting somewhere.”\n\n&gt; Back then she came across as a breath of fresh air, according to a former staffer. “And then I got into the office, and after six months I was like, ‘Man, this is one of the worst people I’ve ever met. I’m going to move back to South Carolina.’”\n\n&gt;Her antics were a problem well before airportgate. During her first term, staffers say Mace would command them to bring her liquor after midnight to keep parties going at her home, which is technically an abuse of her office according to House rules. “Look, when I worked for her, our poor scheduler was getting calls at two o’clock in the morning to come bring her bottles of tequila,” a former staffer claimed of incidents they recalled going back to 2021.\n\n&gt;When they weren’t buying booze for her, they were doing her housework, according to former staffers. They say she made her aides clean multiple properties she was renting out on Airbnb instead of paying for a maid. On Election Night in 2022, for example, Mace instructed aides to spiff up her $3.9 million home in Isle of Palms for a watch party, according to a former staffer with direct knowledge. She would routinely do the same when she rented out her Washington townhouse, according to the same source and other Mace alumni I spoke to, including another former staffer assigned to do the cleaning.\n\n&gt;She was obsessed with monitoring her reputation online. In addition to reportedly having her staff create burner accounts to defend her, Mace allegedly instructed a staffer to go on Reddit forums about the “hottest women in Congress” to boost her standing in the rankings and comment where needed. Mace was “very adamant” about getting the staffer to upvote any posts about the congresswoman and her attractiveness, according to a second former staffer.\n\n&gt;“We were scared of her,” said one of the former aides. “She would make staffers cry. She would threaten to fire them, take their money away, not give them raises, not to give them days off, religious days.” Intimacy only exacerbated the situation. “The closer you get to her, the harder she messes up your brain,” a different former staffer said. “It’s a classic story of ‘never meet your heroes.’”\n\n&gt;One of them recalled dealing with a befuddled Mace on a 2022 trip to Europe, when they say she wanted to fire an aide for telling reporters she was out of the country, claiming it endangered operational security and amounted to “doxxing” her. This despite having told a room full of supporters about the trip at a party in South Carolina beforehand. “She would definitely do it excessively,” they said of the congresswoman’s drinking and marijuana usage. “And again, not to say that most members don’t or most staff don’t, but it got to the point where it was an issue.”", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu5trn", "subreddit": "Fauxmoi", "author": "Goosedukee", "score": 765, "comments": 66, "created_utc": 1770062398.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067693, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "46a481a10a5a4ac9129afea0aa9213ea4515870f", "source": "reddit", "title": "Kid Rock will headline Turning Point USA's alternative Super Bowl halftime show", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu5fb3", "subreddit": "Fauxmoi", "author": "Gato1980", "score": 14, "comments": 40, "created_utc": 1770061519.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067693, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "c701c8dc89bdca6e97dced96e50731abaa86df6b", "source": "reddit", "title": "Nancy Meyers Sets Return After 11 Years With All-Star Comedy Led by Penélope Cruz, Kieran Culkin and Jude Law; Christmas 2027 Release Date Set", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu5eb4", "subreddit": "Fauxmoi", "author": "Giancarlo_Edu", "score": 40, "comments": 6, "created_utc": 1770061460.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067694, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "b9ca513c373862a7d5abc4cf93223ffd0ef4a09f", "source": "reddit", "title": "Sexyy Red performed at the wedding of Donald Trump’s advisor Alex Bruesewitz", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu5d1p", "subreddit": "Fauxmoi", "author": "m8zen", "score": 124, "comments": 45, "created_utc": 1770061385.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067694, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "db2cedfe664316956705fa4daba1454367f7ca58", "source": "reddit", "title": "Director, writer &amp; star of Palestinian drama ‘All That’s Left of You’ Cherien Dabis shares her Subway Hot Take: “If the U.S. is bombing or funding the bombing of your homeland, you shouldn't have to pay taxes.

It's been days since I saw it, and it still makes me smirk to think about the amount of effort and care that went into the punchline. It was like the film equivalent of a long Norm MacDonald joke.  \n\nThe entire time. Hidden beneath the phenomenal performances from Jesse Plemmons and Emma Stone that had me on the edge of my seat **fully** convinced that I was watching a bonafide  psychological thriller not unlike many other movies I have seen in the past; 10 Cloverfield Lane came to mind as an influence and I was constantly comparing Goodman's performance to Plemmons. I was expecting another run of the mill intricate game of cat and mouse between a raving lunatic and their innocent captured prey. Some of the scenes were so visceral and intense that I completely forgot the film I had chosen was classified as 'black comedy'.  \n\nLike a lot of you, it wasn't until very near the end of the movie when the full scope of the trick that had been played on the audience (and myself) became apparent. All at once, it dawned on me that this masterpiece of a film was the comedy equivalent of the sixth sense. The entire time, in retrospect, it is blatantly and unabashedly a comedy. The police officer continuously and intentionally bringing up his past **molesting** Teddy, the 'would be heroes' chemically castrating themselves, the 'over the top' gore in some of the scenes, the bumbling and inept abduction scene, the comically bad special effects when Teddy's vest explodes, even the font that the movie uses is foreshadowing the end...the movie was screaming absurdities from the rooftop the entire time - it's entire premise is hilarious at its surface level, but the actors trick you and push their performances so far it blinds you to the fact that a very very funny story is unfolding before your eyes.  \n\nI can't wait for my second watch through, I'll enjoy looking for all the other extremely blatant clues that I ignored or missed. It's so rare that a movie has the kind of rewatch value that Bugonia does and the fact I get to enjoy the ride twice in completely different ways really speaks to how well the vision of the film was executed.  \n\nBravo.", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu4lyf", "subreddit": "movies", "author": "Nillows", "score": 98, "comments": 61, "created_utc": 1770059788.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770067707, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "dcb4f29a106faac09f5f93498dca6f6720513527", "source": "reddit", "title": "In need of movie recommendation for my birthday!", "body": "Hello!\n\nI am planning to go to the movies with some friends for my birthday, and I would like to watch a good movie that's on the screen for the 15th february. \n\nInitially, I was planning on watching Iron Lung from Markiplier, but after seeing the reviews, I feel a bit discouraged, also that I wouldnt like to watch an slow burn horror for my BD necesarily. \n\nOther options I was looking at were:\n\n\\- All you need is kill (which may not be on theathers by then)\n\n\\- Scarlet (I really liked the premise but Japan and other fans are slashing this movie atm..)\n\nIm based in Canada.

Art is a continuous conversation, and the idea that a story is closed once it achieves classic status prevents the evolution of storytelling.\n\nThroughout human history, we have retold myths, plays, and folk tales for centuries; just because a movie was successful decades ago does not mean the concept is closed off forever. The popular argument that modern creators have run out of ideas conveniently ignores the fact that many pillars of cinema are themselves reinterpretations. Iconic films like John Carpenter’s The Thing and Brian De Palma’s Scarface are remakes that are now considered more culturally significant than their predecessors. Similarly, many of the greatest Westerns were simply samurai movies adapted for a different setting. \n\nIf we had banned the practice of remaking perfect stories forty years ago, we would have missed out on some of the most celebrated cinema in history. Art is not a static object; it is an evolving dialogue between the past and the present. As technology changes, social perspectives shift, and storytelling techniques improve, a reimagining allows a creator to explore a fresh lens that the original may have missed. \n\nA remake does not subtract from the original work, as the earlier version remains unchanged and accessible. Instead, reboots offer a productive risk / reward scenario where a successful hit provides a brand new way to experience a beloved story, while a failure is simply forgotten.

If so, you’ve come to the right place this week. It’s spring cleaning time at NCIS, and Bishop is going all out. Bags and bags of clothes, mementos, accessories, all of it bound for a donation to the VA and all of it raising the eyebrows of her co-workers, who worry that she’s purging her whole life. Delilah, meanwhile, has put together a donation box that includes McGee’s favorite T-shirt, vintage Atari joystick, and ’80s action figure, which feels a little like the step before she hands him actual divorce papers. Worse, Gibbs swoops in and claims the shirt as a new shop rag, while Palmer manages to swipe the rest of McGee’s stuff for Kasie, who’s got her eye on the joystick. But charity donations aren’t driving the case of the week. That would be the murder of Petty Officer Third Class Noah O’Donnell, whose body was dumped in the road with execution-style gunshot wounds in his chest and head. Noah was an intelligence specialist at Quantico who taught self-defense in his spare time and lived with his sister Claire in the small town of Fillmore. The first person to attract NCIS attention is Det. John Fischer, who investigated the unsolved murder of Noah and Claire’s parents 10 years ago. He’s poking around Noah’s murder but trying to keep it quiet so the media attention doesn’t explode like it did during the popular The Fault in Fillmore podcast about the O’Donnell murders, which turned the town into a three-ring circus for weirdos. He’s overall cagey and hostile with NCIS and claims not to know where Claire’s hiding. But Fischer might be on to something. Like his parents, Noah was shot at close range execution-style, and like his parents, the bullets were removed from his body with long tweezers. Also, when the police found Noah and Claire the night of their parents’ murders, they were wandering in the road, which is exactly where Noah’s body was found. So do we have a copycat, or is the original killer back? The team next questions Paul Johansson, a tank of a man who taught self-defense at the same facility as Noah. He says Noah was well-liked, while Claire’s nothing but trouble: unable to hold a job and prone to wandering at night like a zombie. Noah moved in to keep an eye on her, but she dragged him down too. Next stop: the old O’Donnell house, where the murders happened a decade ago. It’s a condemned wreck, and Gibbs and Bishop are keenly aware of all the neighborhood eyes on them as they investigate. (Rule 35: Always watch the watchers!) In the backyard, they find a storage shed with a padlock that has Claire’s initials on it. Once they gain entry, they find a macabre workroom with crime scene photos everywhere and dollhouses that painstakingly recreate the murder scenes depicted. And yes, one of the dollhouses showcases Claire’s own parents’ murder. Back at NCIS, Ducky recognizes them as modern-day nutshells in the style of Frances Glessner Lee, who created a series of crime scene miniatures in the 1940s. Called the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death, they were intricate and beautifully rendered dollhouses that were used to train homicide detectives and forensics students to analyze crime scenes when the field was still in its infancy. Three of the dollhouses feature solved crimes, with the O’Donnell murder the only unsolved one. Sloane wonders aloud if Claire’s a hobbyist coping with trauma through true crime. Then again, NCIS found long-handled tweezers with Noah’s blood on them in Claire’s desk, so she may also have found a different coping mechanism. A talk with the head of the Historical Society Miniature Enthusiast Group reveals that Claire’s the most recent HSMEG member, and she’s fixated on her parents’ murder in part out of fear that the killer isn’t done with her family. Notoriety isn’t done with the family either; when news of Noah’s death hits the news, the O’Donnell house is swarmed by podcast fans there for Claire. The loudest women in the crowd are a goth and a cat sweatshirt aficionado, who remind NCIS that Claire always returns to the scene of the crime in her nocturnal wanderings. Ah, but tonight she has a new crime scene to visit. Gibbs heads straight to the stretch of road where Noah’s body was found, and there’s Claire, brandishing Noah’s gun for protection. Gibbs gently suggests that her parents would want her to come into the light, and he escorts her to NCIS for questioning. Vance, seeing a traumatized young woman who lost her parents, scampers off to call his kids. Claire starts things off by asking Gibbs, “Has anyone you love ever been killed?” (Oh dear. So many.) Then she says Noah was helping her solve their parents’ murders and must’ve uncovered something. “He’s dead because of me.” In fact, Noah did have an almost illegible evidence custody document on his body, and Claire has an alibi thanks to the #WheresClaire hashtag with photos of sightings that night placing her nowhere near Noah’s body. Time for a new suspect. At this point, Fischer storms NCIS, demanding to know why Claire’s being held. He tells Gibbs that he’ll never forget coming across the O’Donnell kids the night of the murders, and he spits out that the only reason he didn’t solve the case years ago was because a bureaucrat like Gibbs wouldn’t spare the budget to exhume the body of the transient man Fischer liked for the crime to compare it to a DNA sample. Gibbs takes another run at getting answers from Claire, which he does by proving his investigative chops on her nutshells: a murder/suicide stemming from a financial dispute. An acquaintance kidnapping. Robbery/arson/murder. That last one stops Claire short. It’s the nutshell that Noah built, although it was officially ruled an electrical fire thanks to bad wiring, not arson. “We’ve been looking into the wrong case,” Gibbs realizes. This new case involves the recently widowed Louise Fitzgerald, who was worth millions and found dead in her burned home. If Noah started to suspect murder, that points in a whole different direction. Specifically, it points toward the self-defense classes, which Louise attended with Noah… and his buddy Paul, whose day job is an electrician. Paul realizes the jig is up and tries to run, charging directly at Bishop. He’s easily twice her size and clearly intends to bowl her over and escape, but she drops and sweeps her leg in his path, taking him down. It’s … it’s impressive. In short order, we learn that Paul had gambling debts, so he stole from Louise, killed her, and set the fire to cover it up. When Noah asked for his input on how someone might stage an electrical fire, Paul killed him and tried to frame Claire. The case solved, Sloane urges Claire to make an appointment to start therapy with Grace Confalone, while Kasie tries to recruit Claire to join her in forensics. Claire declines but mentions that someone recently offered her $10,000 to build their daughter a dollhouse. OOOH, DO THAT, CLAIRE! Also, Ducky called in a favor and got an exhumation order for the suspect in the O’Donnell parents’ murder, so Claire heads off to meet with Fischer, hopeful that he can deliver the same justice she helped provide for Noah. In the final minutes of the episode, Bishop slides onto the Elevator of Schemes and Secrets with Gibbs and rather defensively tells him that she’s giving away all her things because she’s evolved and isn’t the same person that she was when she started. Gibbs doesn’t disagree, but he does remind her, “You can’t erase it all,” handing her the OSU Pistol Pete hat he plucked from her donation pile. Then Bishop gets a text from Odette that reads, “Tomorrow 6 a.m.” Who’s ready for secret agent Bishop, y’all? Stray shots Very cool episode tonight! While the podcast fandom could’ve been fleshed out into something bigger and more fun, the mystery itself and Claire’s sad story were well done, and the ambiguous ending leaves us with a little frisson of uncertainty. Will Claire ever find a resolution to her parents’ murders? Torres quote of the week: “Are you trying to tell me how to Kondo?” Hey, CBS, I’d watch a 24-episode series of people solving crimes based on nutshell dollhouses. Likewise, I would watch many seasons of Claire building gorgeous dollhouses and solving crimes. Either or both would be fabulous. Hit me up. Speaking of the nutshell dollhouses: Frances Glessner Lee is real and did, in fact, utilize a traditionally feminine craft to excel in the male-dominated world of law enforcement in the 1940s.

Over the last decade, she’s evolved from morally conflicted superspy to avenging hero and, ultimately, the sacrificial savior of the universe. With Nat finally stepping into the spotlight for her own solo film, EW asked Johansson to look back on a key scene from every Black Widow appearance. Iron Man 2 (2010)The superspy made her MCU debut with a brutal hallway fight, knocking down bad guys and setting up her next decade on screen. “A lot of the moves are really spider-like, they’re balletic, and they pay homage to Natasha’s past,” Johansson explains. “I’m still doing a lot of those moves today, just a little bit more creaky.” Time comes for us all, even trained assassins. The Avengers (2012)One of Natasha’s key moments comes early in The Avengers, as she and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) verbally spar and try to wheedle information out of each other. It’s one of the audience’s first glimpses into Natasha’s past, and Johansson says the scene owes its back-and-forth energy to Avengers writer-director Joss Whedon. “It’s got this great dramatic intensity, and then it’s just super playful,” she adds. Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)Johansson and Captain America star Chris Evans first worked together a decade earlier in 2004’s The Perfect Score, and the actress says it’s their off-screen friendship that made scenes like this — where Steve and Nat — so effortless. “It’s really a result of 10 years of knowing somebody and being able to have a kind of intimacy with them that I think you get from just spending a lot of time with somebody and knowing their soft underbelly,” she says. Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)As a general rule, most spies dedicate their careers to putting up walls, but this Age of Ultron moment with Mark Ruffalo‘s Bruce Banner is a rare moment of vulnerability for Nat. As for the scene itself — in which Natasha opens up about her forced sterilization and inability to have children — filming it required a bit of movie magic. “ ironic because I was also really pregnant at the time,” Johansson adds with a laugh. Captain America: Civil War (2016)Until Infinity War united its heroes for the fight against Thanos, 2016’s Civil War held the record for the most Avengers in one place, thanks to its climactic airport runway battle. On the days Johansson shot the scene in Atlanta, the temperature of the tarmac soared above 100 degrees — but the result, she says, was worth it. “I remember both sides running at each other, full speed charging at each other, and you knew that the universe would be forever changed after that.” Avengers: Infinity War (2018)The final Wakanda battle in Infinity War sees Natasha teaming up with Elizabeth Olsen‘s Scarlet Witch and Danai Gurira‘s Okoye to take down Proxima Midnight (Carrie Coon). “We were just this random other unit that was fighting in a ditch for like weeks,” Johansson says with a laugh. “When Lizzie came along, we were like, ‘And where have you been! You get to do the awesome hero pose, and we’ve been eating dirt for three weeks!'” Avengers: Endgame (2019)Nat’s final hero moment, where she sacrifices herself for the Soul Stone, was originally filmed as a chase scene with an “army of Dementor-type creatures,” Johansson reveals. “I was thinking, ‘Parents will never forgive us for how these creatures look.'” But the sequence felt too busy in an already action-packed film, so she and Jeremy Renner later reshot it as a quieter, more emotional confrontation. “We wanted to leave with the weight of that loss and the shock of it,” Johansson says. Black Widow (2020)Audiences at 2019’s San Diego Comic-Con were treated to an early cut of this scene from the solo Black Widow movie, where Nat reunites with her “sister,” Florence Pugh‘s Yelena Belova — and they proceed to beat the crap out of each other. (It was also one of the first scenes Pugh and Johansson shot together, and it forced them to get up close and personal fast.) “It’s like when you see prize fighters who have come together to have a second go at it, and you know that there’s all that built-up tension in a good kind of way,” Johansson explains. BONUS SCENE: The Avengers (2012)One of Johansson’s personal highlights is the moment the Avengers, well, assembled, for the now-iconic 360-degree shot during the Battle of New York. “I remember all of us assembling in that circle and looking around,” she explains. “All of us had a moment where we were like, ‘Oh.

Definitely encourage a read.\n\n\\- It was a return to the kind of exposure therapy Pullman had started at around the age of 12. At school, a teacher noticed Pullman spitting into napkins and litter bins. She didn’t know that he was doing the rituals because he believed that he was harboring bad thoughts in his saliva. If he were to swallow before cleansing his palate, he felt something bad would happen to someone he loved.\n\nThe school alerted Pullman’s mother to his behavior, and a doctor diagnosed him with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Pullman began seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist who put him through a series of exposure exercises. “I’m going to drive home after our session, and I’m going to crash my car and die,” the analyst might say. “Don’t perform any of your rituals until I text you that I made it home.”\n\nIn the decades since, therapy like this has helped quiet the voice in Pullman’s head. But it hasn’t eradicated it.\n\n\\- His unexpected candor about his mental health prompts me to reveal that I, too, have struggled with OCD. We begin comparing notes on the specificity of our particular rituals—I excessively wash my hands, he avoids certain numbers—and how it’s hard to stop them until your brain tells you it “feels right.”\n\n”I’ve done something probably 100 times that you probably haven’t noticed,” he says, explaining how he’s been looking to the right of a pillar in his line of sight, swallowing and then shifting his vision to the left. (He’s right; I hadn’t noticed.) It’s a weird thing to bond over, but Pullman invites my vulnerability with his own.\n\n\\- **As a boy,** **Pullman wasn’t interested in becoming an actor.** He liked to drum and paint. When he was nine, he visited his dad on the set of 2002’s *Igby Goes Down*, but inadvertently arrived when his father was shooting a scene that required him to shatter a glass wall and sob in a pool of blood. “After that, Mom was like, ‘Yeah, we’re not doing this,’” he says.\n\n\\- Moving forward, Pullman says, his aim is to forge a career that is a mix of this type of “real guerrilla warfare, in the trenches” indie work, and larger tentpole films. (He just shot a 60-second Michelob Ultra commercial with Kurt Russell, which will air during the Super Bowl and paid him “way, way more” than *Ann Lee*.) It’s the kind of balance his dad has been able to maintain over the years, oscillating between summer hits like *Independence Day* and [David Lynch’s](https://www.gq.com/story/david-lynch-tells-gq-his-secrets-to-happiness) *Lost Highway*. The two of them just spent three months in Australia working together for the first time on a sequel to *Spaceballs*, the Mel Brooks comedy that Pullman senior was part of in 1987.\n\n“I was nervous—not for any reasons that were warranted, but a son is so attuned to every micro-expression of his father, and it’s really hard to turn those instincts off and be the character,” says the younger Pullman. “If he’s judging me, I never hear it. He’s always led with love and encouragement. One of the main ways that I benefit from nepotism is that I was so wholly supported in this endeavor.”", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qtzb1b", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "Optimal-Shoulder-186", "score": 29, "comments": 19, "created_utc": 1770048770.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770068702, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "a4437296df8061363d76dd241c066d80567c272b", "source": "reddit", "title": "An emotional Bad Bunny hugs Harry Styles after he won Album of the Year at the 2026 Grammys", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qtz7fm", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "storminthedark", "score": 856, "comments": 43, "created_utc": 1770048554.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770068702, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "f5b85baebdec803260acf793335111de6481fbc3", "source": "reddit", "title": "Kristen Stewart Says She Chose to Come Out in 2017 Because She Didn't Want to 'Live a Partial Life'", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qtyuig", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "mcfw31", "score": 33, "comments": 2, "created_utc": 1770047801.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770068703, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "a6f118fe62e2c3d206aea7d54289dafd8bd5a712", "source": "reddit", "title": "Alex Warren acknowledges pitchy Grammys performance in new TikTok", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qtytp7", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "monster_ahhh", "score": 910, "comments": 141, "created_utc": 1770047754.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770068703, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "a999573f2c03e54f493e93b20b5ec41b10863bba", "source": "reddit", "title": "Halle Berry says she “pretty much stopped doing interviews for a decade” because she “got tired of the same old story”:  “It was always: ‘Poor Halle — Unlucky in Love Again.'\"", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu8ciq", "subreddit": "Fauxmoi", "author": "hairtie1", "score": 4, "comments": 1, "created_utc": 1770067820.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770068703, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "68c7d5bbeaf483c9f55eda948cb882141481ae66", "source": "reddit", "title": "Amanda Seyfried's most iconic line", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu7z5v", "subreddit": "Fauxmoi", "author": "demimonde9", "score": 32, "comments": 3, "created_utc": 1770067007.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770068703, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "49342af52c994bd86b8db107477e0b10e94b5b93", "source": "reddit", "title": "Connor Storrie and Francois Arnaud pose to W Magazine", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu7x0h", "subreddit": "Fauxmoi", "author": "strachey", "score": 32, "comments": 5, "created_utc": 1770066874.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770068703, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "781ada8401567a5c63a73c998961888c72ba58c9", "source": "reddit", "title": "Katseye's Megan cheering on Katseye from the audience at the Grammys", "body": "for [reference](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1qae57u/laufey_corrects_photographers_at_the_golden/)", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu7i5c", "subreddit": "Fauxmoi", "author": "demimonde9", "score": 33, "comments": 6, "created_utc": 1770065981.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770068704, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "020e0406249a86e0caf210f28b194dd80ed5ffe0", "source": "reddit", "title": "Margot Robbie in custom Chanel by Matthieu Blazy at the \"Wuthering Heights\" premiere in Paris.

She could come off as a bit nuts, but that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing in the age of Trump. One person close to Mace recalled the way Bill Maher described meeting Trump for the first time. In this person’s experience, Mace was not a crazy person but someone who played one on TV.\n\n&gt;Five years in, however, it’s unclear if Mace actually knows the difference between the two, according to former staffers. “We’ve moved past that now,” the person said. “Something’s broken. The motherboard’s fried. We’re short-circuiting somewhere.”\n\n&gt; Back then she came across as a breath of fresh air, according to a former staffer. “And then I got into the office, and after six months I was like, ‘Man, this is one of the worst people I’ve ever met. I’m going to move back to South Carolina.’”\n\n&gt;Her antics were a problem well before airportgate. During her first term, staffers say Mace would command them to bring her liquor after midnight to keep parties going at her home, which is technically an abuse of her office according to House rules. “Look, when I worked for her, our poor scheduler was getting calls at two o’clock in the morning to come bring her bottles of tequila,” a former staffer claimed of incidents they recalled going back to 2021.\n\n&gt;When they weren’t buying booze for her, they were doing her housework, according to former staffers. They say she made her aides clean multiple properties she was renting out on Airbnb instead of paying for a maid. On Election Night in 2022, for example, Mace instructed aides to spiff up her $3.9 million home in Isle of Palms for a watch party, according to a former staffer with direct knowledge. She would routinely do the same when she rented out her Washington townhouse, according to the same source and other Mace alumni I spoke to, including another former staffer assigned to do the cleaning.\n\n&gt;She was obsessed with monitoring her reputation online. In addition to reportedly having her staff create burner accounts to defend her, Mace allegedly instructed a staffer to go on Reddit forums about the “hottest women in Congress” to boost her standing in the rankings and comment where needed. Mace was “very adamant” about getting the staffer to upvote any posts about the congresswoman and her attractiveness, according to a second former staffer.\n\n&gt;“We were scared of her,” said one of the former aides. “She would make staffers cry. She would threaten to fire them, take their money away, not give them raises, not to give them days off, religious days.” Intimacy only exacerbated the situation. “The closer you get to her, the harder she messes up your brain,” a different former staffer said. “It’s a classic story of ‘never meet your heroes.’”\n\n&gt;One of them recalled dealing with a befuddled Mace on a 2022 trip to Europe, when they say she wanted to fire an aide for telling reporters she was out of the country, claiming it endangered operational security and amounted to “doxxing” her. This despite having told a room full of supporters about the trip at a party in South Carolina beforehand. “She would definitely do it excessively,” they said of the congresswoman’s drinking and marijuana usage. “And again, not to say that most members don’t or most staff don’t, but it got to the point where it was an issue.”", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu5trn", "subreddit": "Fauxmoi", "author": "Goosedukee", "score": 983, "comments": 82, "created_utc": 1770062398.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770068704, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "1126188112f04b694361739fb03da3319af1fec6", "source": "reddit", "title": "Kid Rock will headline Turning Point USA's alternative Super Bowl halftime show", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu5fb3", "subreddit": "Fauxmoi", "author": "Gato1980", "score": 21, "comments": 46, "created_utc": 1770061519.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770068704, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "ceaed854b136b34f052157145e08052a4c1e4961", "source": "reddit", "title": "Nancy Meyers Sets Return After 11 Years With All-Star Comedy Led by Penélope Cruz, Kieran Culkin and Jude Law; Christmas 2027 Release Date Set", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu5eb4", "subreddit": "Fauxmoi", "author": "Giancarlo_Edu", "score": 42, "comments": 6, "created_utc": 1770061460.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770068705, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "9e4bebb3226f9405724a7637e3d9cf314b2c2bde", "source": "reddit", "title": "Sexyy Red performed at the wedding of Donald Trump’s advisor Alex Bruesewitz", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1qu5d1p", "subreddit": "Fauxmoi", "author": "m8zen", "score": 149, "comments": 51, "created_utc": 1770061385.0, "priority": 60, "event_type": "item", "ts": 1770068705, "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "348b7a4428badd292cf186a4299bab6bc2557951", "source": "reddit", "title": "Director, writer &amp; star of Palestinian drama ‘All That’s Left of You’ Cherien Dabis shares her Subway Hot Take: “If the U.S. is bombing or funding the bombing of your homeland, you shouldn't have to pay taxes.

I was expecting another run of the mill intricate game of cat and mouse between a raving lunatic and their innocent captured prey.

All at once, it dawned on me that this masterpiece of a film was the comedy equivalent of the sixth sense. The entire time, in retrospect, it is blatantly and unabashedly a comedy. The police officer continuously and intentionally bringing up his past **molesting** Teddy, the 'would be heroes' chemically castrating themselves, the 'over the top' gore in some of the scenes, the bumbling and inept abduction scene, the comically bad special effects when Teddy's vest explodes, even the font that the movie uses is foreshadowing the end...the movie was screaming absurdities from the rooftop the entire time - it's entire premise is hilarious at its surface level, but the actors trick you and push their performances so far it blinds you to the fact that a very very funny story is unfolding before your eyes.  \n\nI can't wait for my second watch through, I'll enjoy looking for all the other extremely blatant clues that I ignored or missed.

However, in a time where our world (and, sure, maybe even the galaxy) has been thrust into mass hysteria and people are hoarding toilet paper as though they might soon participate in their own personal turd-orbit … these moments of space-chaos were somehow both funny and poignant. While the Avenue 5 writers couldn’t have known the specific state the world would be in when they wrote this finale, the series has always been about the ways in which people begin panicking in the face of impending disaster, while simultaneously denying the reality of their own doom, making it worse through their own selfishness, and ignoring the few people who actually know what they’re talking about. And tonight, that funhouse mirror just slid right into place, didn’t it?! To quote Captain Clark, the fake captain of a luxury spaceship orbited by human feces whose only value is his fingerprints: “We just watched seven people stupid themselves to death.” Ever the agent of chaos, Matt has changed the code to the airlocks and hidden himself somewhere in the ship so as not to cause any more harm after watching seven people happily march to their space-deaths with the code he gave them last week. The other assembled main characters briefly believe that Matt’s message means he’s gone to kill himself and flood his inbox with messages encouraging him not to do that after Captain Clark first sends him a bracelet-butt-dial voice recording that says, “Life without you would be,” looooong pause, “the only word I could think of was easier!” And everyone else’s overlapping messages are just as in line with their own personalities including, “Hey Matt, it’s Judd from work … you’re the son I never had, the lover I never wanted,” and capped off perfectly by Iris: “Matt, those people were fucking idiots, we’re better off with them, now give us the goddamn codes.” Billie makes the startling announcement that if they don’t get the airlock code to jettison the excess weight off of the ship within the hour, they’ll be stuck with the original three and a half year trajectory. Not to mention, as Cyrus notes, they need that code to retrieve Captain Joe’s hands and head to take control of the ship’s steering for their emergency docking since Captain Clark stands no chance of being able to do it himself. So everyone splits up to search for Matt while Karen and Iris — a formidable duo if ever there was one — are tasked with ramping up the donations for jettisoning. And that formidable duo becomes a terrifying trio as Rav finally makes her way onboard and finds out from the passengers dragging their guitars and dumbbells to be thrown off the ship that seven humans also recently decided to throw themselves off. “Is that it — just a simple ‘Rav?!'” Rav screams when Iris calmly greets her while dragging a giant golden horse out of Judd’s cabin. “See, I was expecting something more along the lines of, uh, ‘Sorry for surrounding our groundbreaking luxury cruise liner with s— and corpses.'” But this is a luxury poop-and-cadaver cruise of everyone’s making, not just Iris. Or, as Matt informs Judd and Captain Clark while they roam the lower deck of the ship screaming his name in a high-pitched voice and find him casually getting a candy bar from the vending machines: “Well … we’re all hiding.” And while Matt has been hiding and plunging the ship into chaos once more, he’s been carefully itemizing his thoughts. Though 309: “Every year we pass the pre-anniversary of our death, but we don’t even know it, so we don’t get presents.” And thought 14: “Poor octopus — eight arms, but no hands. F— you, God!” And like the eight handless arms of the hopeless being that they are, the whole gang suddenly converges at Matt’s non-hiding spot. They all demand that he give them the code, but Matt doesn’t give it up until Rav threatens physical violence after just proving her merit by backhanding Judd to Jupiter. The code is 0-0-0-5 for Avenue 5: “I made it so that anyone thinking rationally would be able to guess it, and anyone thinking irrationally, anyone suicidal, would not.” Judd, thinking only of himself, sprints away toward the supply shuttle to catch his ride back to Earth, and everyone races after him. Karen is busy threatening to take people’s teeth if they don’t get their final jettisoning items to her, but she soon also joins the gang, just in time to see Judd board the supply ship. Judd demands that the pilot “go, go go!” but the pilot tells him it doesn’t work that way; he’s just there to press two buttons at the right time and the rest is automated. So in the meantime, Jordan the comedian asks Judd through the speaker system why he would want to go back to Earth since everyone hates him there on account of that time when Judd contemplated mass murder. And when Judd comes bustling off the ship, Jordan sprints onboard before anyone knows what’s happened. “Jordan, I did like you, but I am very, very weird!” Billie yells at him, correctly. After the pilot deboards to change his travel catheter, Doug grabs Mia’s hand in an act of passion, and rushes on board the supply ship, wrestling Jordan out of there and claiming the two seats as their own… Until Cyrus returns from his mission outside with Captain Joe’s head and hands (all of which have exploded beyond use), and Captain Clark goes absolutely nuts, his British accent raising to a decibel we’ve yet to hear. “That’s it!” he screams as he rushes on the supply ship. “My patience has snapped like a 100-year-old breadstick! I am the captain still, and I decide who stays and who goes!” And even though he wasn’t asking for that person to be him, everyone just sort of decides it should be. “You’re very unhappy,” Matt tells him. “You know that thing you do, where you act sarcastic so we all feel sorry for you? It works — we do.” Everyone raises their hand in an emotional salute as the pilot hits his second button and the ship truly begins its final countdown to whisk Captain Clark back to Earth… Well, everyone except Billie, who stands there with her arms crossed until Captain Clark realizes he has to stay because he’s still the only one who can steer the ship. Captain Clark deboards, Jordan rushes on again, and as the supply ship countdown grows lower, Karen also starts the countdown for the jettison. She’s gathered enough items, and they’ll make it just under the hour that Billie forewarned. And as two clashing countdowns, both in Judd’s voice, play at once, that familiar feeling of chaos begins to descend: “This is like psychosis but with none of the advantages!” Iris now rushes on board the supply ship to physically remove Jordan so that Mr. Judd can come on board as was the original plan. And while Judd is refusing because he doesn’t want to go back to Earth where he’s hated, the countdown for the jettison completes, and the ship shakes as the items weighing as much as 500 people are launched into space. “We just jettisoned from the portside airlocks, we’re gonna be home in six months baby,” Karen proudly announces. “You jettisoned out of the rear, not the portside” Billie corrects, as Billie is wont to do. But Karen meant what she said. Captain Clark begin screaming at Karen that the whole point was to launch the weight out of the back of the ship to propel them forward. “You’ve gotta s— out of the back of the ship — this is basic s—ing!” As everyone yells that even babies know how to s— correctly, Karen crumbles realizing her mistake — “I feel like I’m dying and my teeth are falling off!” — demanding that Frank do something worse to take the attention off of her. But nothing could be worse than what Karen has done. Cyrus announces that their new earliest trajectory for a potential rescue is… “Eight years?!” Matt yells. “That’s longer than the Beatles were together; that’s longer than the Seven Years’ War!” And with that, the doors to the supply shuttle slam shut with Iris still inside, and Judd still on the ship screaming her name. “Do you think she can hear me?” he asks Captain Clark. A FEW SPACE NUGGETS: No, but you may as well keep screaming, indeed, folks! This is the last chance to mention it, so I should mention it: the score of Avenue 5 has been incredible, like a lead character all its own. “You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t stop it from throwing itself violently out of an airlock.” “You can with the most basic horse harness.” “Why do I keep thinking I’m clever? I’m not. On a good day, I’m barely not stupid!” I’m all for Captain Clark’s existential reckoning with his own intelligence, but I draw the line at shaving his beard. As does Judd: “Beardedness is actually in your contract.” Thanks for reading along, folks, and just remember — there is beauty to be found in even the turd-iest of poop-orbits.

Let’s start with the latter story: Nia’s roommate Yvette insists that Nia not spend another night “crying over that weird little man” (ha!) and instead come out with her to meet her new boyfriend Angus, whom she’s been chatting with on dating app UpSwipes for three weeks. Nia agrees, but at the club, she has a vision that she can’t interpret while Yvette is lured to the alley by a text from Angus. But Angus isn’t Angus; he’s a predatory bigot who attacks her and gives her a message for Dreamer: “The world doesn’t want a trans superhero.” He warns that if Dreamer doesn’t stop her superheroics, he’ll keep attacking the trans community. It’s ugly and awful, and although a National City detective promises to do his best to find the attacker, Nia wants to put an end to the man who hurt and humiliated her roommate herself. But Kara urges her to let the police and Supergirl bring him to justice. “There is no hope speech that can make this better,” Nia tells Kara, but she reluctantly agrees to give law enforcement a few hours to make the arrest. After her ordeal, Yvette begins deleting all of her social media, tired of making herself a target as a trans woman of color. Nia urges her not to. “They want us to be invisible because of their own fears. They want to erase us, so we need to shine even brighter.” Then Nia moves forward with her own plans, setting up a profile on UpSwipes to lure out the attacker. Kara, meanwhile, enlists the help of Brainy, who’s morosely watching footage of Dreamer taking down a Dominator. He pushes aside his feelings and agrees to help. Then Kara helps William with his story on Yvette’s attack. They discuss just how often violence against the transgender community is misreported or underreported, often because the victims are misgendered in police reports, which gives her a glimpse at what’s driving Nia’s quest for justice. (All true, by the way, and kudos to this episode for highlighting these statistics this for viewers who may not be aware.) Nia’s gambit pays off, and she arrives at an UpSwipes meetup as Dreamer, where she confronts Yvette’s attacker. He pulls a knife on her and spews all kinds of vile hate. Dreamer has him lassoed around the neck when Supergirl shows up, having been alerted by Brainy about Nia’s dating profile. Despite Nia’s earlier warning, Supergirl gives her a hope speech: don’t stoop to this man’s level; she, Alex, J’onn, and Brainy will help keep Nia’s community safe now that they’re more aware of the dangers they face. And with that, Dreamer lets Supergirl make the arrest, although not before threatening the man if he returns to his hate crimes after he’s released from prison. At CatCo later that night, Kara finds Nia crying on the balcony. She’s overwhelmed and upset at how badly she wanted to murder the attacker. Also, she couldn’t interpret her dream just like she couldn’t save her mother’s life, and she’s still heartbroken that the one person who supported and loved her ended their relationship without an explanation. Kara apologizes for not considering Nia’s lived experiences but reiterates that not lashing out with violence against the bad guys is what separates them from the bad guys. Also, Brainy worked his mojo and found the attacker’s online hate group, which he hands over to the detective on the case. “The DEO takes threats against our sister superheroes very seriously,” says an emotionless Brainy. Give us back our old Brainy soon, please! The other half of this episode starts two months ago, when a mean-eyed man watches a happy couple hop into a sled pulled by a white tiger (goals!) in a North Pole VR setting, then get stuck inside when the end-simulation function glitches. Kelly pulls him out and reports the failsafe glitch. We then jump ahead to today, when Al from the alien bar asks J’onn and Alex for help finding his brother, who checked into a hotel a week ago for a weekend escape experience at Obsidian Platinum’s Virtual Las Vegas. While J’onn searches for Trevor’s physical person, Alex puts on the lenses and searches for him virtually with a real-world link to Kelly to guide her. In the VR, Alex is greeted with a number of experience options based on her own desires, including one that looks a little like Alex-as-Supergirl and one with her cradling a baby. But she heads to the old-school Vegas simulator and quickly finds a spooky haunted house on a hill, which is thoroughly out of place in the Nevada desert. Kelly explains that this is one of the customized add-ons that Obsidian allows advanced users to create without any regulation or oversight, which … yikes. That seems like a big loophole. Alex walks into the house and finds it set up like the tank where Rick Malverne nearly drowned her. Kelly explains that it’s designed to tap into the user’s worst fears, and worse, the failsafe glitch from a few months ago hasn’t been fixed, so the two men in the tanks have been tortured for days. This could lead to actual brain damage, so Alex uses her new Hand of the Soldier Martian tech, which isn’t cooperating in the real world, to set them free. They confirm that they’re friends of Trevor’s, and he passed through the adjacent wooden door with Richard, a new guy in their group. In the real world, J’onn locates Richard’s wife. She’s the woman who climbed into the sled with Trevor in the North Pole VR, which makes Richard the man who watched in envy. His wife admits to a VR affair with Trevor, and J’onn quickly puts it together that her computer programmer husband Richard created a trap for Trevor. Alas, Alex doesn’t learn any of that because she loses contact with Kelly once she steps through the door and finds Trevor frozen in fear, his whole body lighting up to explode from within before he’s reconfigured to painfully explode again, over and over. When Richard shows up to watch Trevor suffer, Alex shoots him and sends him rocketing out of the simulation. He comes to in his hotel room, eyes disgustingly bloody around the lenses, to be taken into custody by J’onn. In the VR, Alex talks Trevor into shutting down the next explosion and gets him to tell her what hotel he’s checked into so she and J’onn can rescue him in the real world. After everyone’s safe and sound, Kelly and Alex reconvene at the alien bar. Kelly confirms that it shouldn’t have been possible for Alex to eject Richard from the simulation and that the failsafe glitch wasn’t corrected after all. Also, virtual romance is cheating, and virtual torture is real attempted murder. Good to know! Then Trevor shows up to thank Alex in person. This storyline wraps up with an unconscious Richard being wheeled away from his hospital room by Margot, the Leviathan liaison, to be wrapped up like a silver burrito and suspended from the ceiling alongside other silver-wrapped humans. What do you want with these people, Leviathan, and why am I suddenly craving Chipotle? Finally, J’onn encourages Alex to give herself more time with her Hand of the Soldier tech, reminding her that it’ll instinctively bond with her bioelectric pulses if she lets it in. But as they end their training session, Alex gets a call from her mother and heads straight to Kara’s apartment with dreadful news: their father Jeremiah is dead. Snaps of the cape Nicole Maines killed it this week as Nia. Thank you for telling a too-often overlooked story about a too-often overlooked community, Supergirl. Despite the important message this week, this episode did reveal a growing crack in the season: with Alex not at the DEO, her storylines are starting to feel disconnected to the Supergirl storylines. Here’s hoping those can be stitched together more closely in future episodes. Woof, that Kara/William date was … rough. Sure, she was nervous after two and a half years off the market, but that was incredibly awkward, no?

After this we can get down to the business of making dreams and crushing souls. Should be fun! Before we enter Hollywood Week, however, we have one last batch of auditions. These aren’t anything to bat an eye at either, there are some truly heartbreaking stories tonight and some talent that feels like, dare I say, “Top 10 material.” Who am I, Katy Perry? Let’s take a look at which hopefuls make it through to the next round: Robert Taylor, 27, Donaldsonville, La.“Bruises” by Lewis CapaldiRight out of the gate and Idol has me crying already? Maybe it’s just spiked anxiety from, you know, life, but wow wow wow am I here for Robert Taylor (you may remember him from Team Christina on Season 8 of The Voice, BTW) to make it on this show. Being here is a big deal for him: He only recently came out, and was disowned by everyone except his dad, who wanted him to audition for Idol, but as his true self. His dad has passed in January. So anyway, we’re all crying. THANKFULLY, Robert crushes his audition. The emotion just pours out of his vocals. Grace Leer, 27, Nashville, Tenn.“Crowded Table” by The Highwomen // “Crazy” by Patsy ClineA comeback kid! Grace was a contestant on the long-forgot American Juniors (Idol for kids) when she was 11, but opted for a normal childhood afterward. Now she is pursuing country music in Nashville and guys, she is very good. She has a classic country voice, complete with a little yodel and that cry that’ll give you goosebumps. Throughout her audition the judges cannot stop smiling – they’ve found a good one. Katy asks Grace to sing a “sad country song” just to hear her voice on it (still great). They love the texture of her voice and that she knows exactly the kind of artist she wants to be. Oh, it’s going to be fun to watch Grace move forward. Franklin Boone, 27, Durham, N.C.“Dreams” by Fleetwood MacI love when Luke Bryan gets all giggly during an audition. He does that here with Franklin, a teacher at the School of Rock, and declares this the “Alejandro moment” of the season. And after Franklin performs a cool, stripped down version of “Dreams,” Lionel gushes: He loves that Franklin’s come in with style in his voice, in his look, and in his attitude – Franklin’s already a complete package. Luke calls him a “first note kind of singer,” meaning that he knew everything he needed to from the moment Franklin opened his mouth. Will Hollywood Week ruin this true artist? Only time will tell – how exciting! Roselyn Carter, 26, Watts, Calif.“Mother Bowed” by The Pilgrim Travelers // “So High” by John LegendHere’s another audition in which one judge is completely moved from the get-go. Roselyn explains that she’s here to set an example for people in her town, to show them there is a way out of the gang violence, as well as to hopefully find a way to continue to provide for her family. Her voice is raw and full of emotion, and I’m so glad Katy has her sing something a little more contemporary, because Roselyn sounds even better on the John Legend song. Lionel tells her that her interpretation of both those songs “knocks out” and they can’t wait to help Roselyn hone her skills as she moves forward in this competition. Megan Knight, 21, Williamston, N.J.“When Your Mind’s Made Up” by Glen HansardIt’s a beautiful day in Washington, D.C. and the judges want to go sunning on a boat. Who are we to deny them this? It’s clearly all so that Katy can force Luke and Lionel into a triple “I’m flying, Jack! I’m flying!” situation and I don’t blame her. The audition on that boat isn’t the most exciting: The judges give Megan a lot of constructive criticism – she’s overplaying her guitar and overusing her vibrato – but eventually hand over a golden ticket. They weren’t about to end this segment with a rejection, were they? Gilberto Rivera, 23, Orlando, Fla.“Proud Mary” by Tina TurnerWell, the judges did say they are looking for some unidentifiable “x-factor” right? Gilberto – a very hairy guy in a sequined tank and thigh high red boots – certainly gives this his all, complete with some classic “Proud Mary” choreography. Gilberto is a decent singer – he hits a lot of runs and can handle the Tina Turner-ness of it all. The judges can see this, but want him to strip away all the gimmicks. His voice should be the real show. The gimmick is too much for Lionel to get over, so he’s a hard ‘no’ but both Katy and Luke want to see what happens when Gilberto drops the act…and waxes his chest, I guess? That’s where we are now, as a show. Gilberto and his red boots earn a golden ticket. Aliana Jester, 18, Tampa, Fla.“Who’s Lovin’ You” by The MiraclesOkay, this is a story. When Aliana was 12, her mother, who was raising her alone, joined a “religion” and when Aliana didn’t want to join and eventually started dating a non-religious person, her mother got so angry she basically locked her in her room. It’s awful and Aliana almost didn’t survive. Finally, she was able to contact her father and he got her out of there. He saved her life. It’s wild. But now she’s here on Idol with her cute emotional support dog, making things happen for herself. Aliana has a big ol’ booming voice. The judges want her to infuse more emotion into her performance, but other than that they are in love. She reminds Lionel of a “young Whitney” and what more of a response do you need than that? Jahzan, 18, Kingston, Jamaica“Warrior” by Demi LovatoIdol is really hitting these big stories hard tonight. Jahzan and her mother fled from Jamaica when she was 15 “for safety” reasons, but says she’s not allowed to expand on it any further than that. Now, she and her mother live in their uncle’s salon in New York and busk for money. Her mother is her hypewoman and they’re both putting all of their hopes for a better life into this audition basket. Jahzan has a crazy unique voice – Katy says it’s a mix of Toni Braxton, Cher, and Shakira, if that helps you at all – but it is definitely unpolished and lacks control. The judges, however, see lots of potential and are moved by her story, so they are willing to help coach her, and so hand her a ticket to Hollywood Week. Jordan Moyes, 25, Provo, Utah“I’m On Fire” by Bruce SpringsteenHey, it’s another artist giving Luke Bryan the giggles. More than that, during Jordan’s audition, Luke leans over to Katy and whispers, “I want to sign him now.” Honestly, he should do that! It’s a way easier path than suffering through rounds and rounds of Idol! Luke is enamored with his skills on the guitar, his delivery, and his vocals. It’s a haunting cover of this Bruce classic. Lionel just says that Jordan is “very, very, very good” which doesn’t sound like a lot, but guys, it’s the way he says it. The judges love Jordan. Demi Rae, 26, San Jose, Calif.“Mad At You” by Noah CyrusDemi Rae is legit sunshine and I am thankful! for! her! First of all, she’s rocking a pink sweatshirt, biker shorts, gems on her eyelids, and some serious hair clips. More important, when she was nine, she wrote down that her dream was to be on American Idol, and even though her home life hasn’t been ideal, she is here, making it happen! Okay, wait, actually most important: SHE CAN SING. Luke is especially impressed by her “perfectly done falsetto runs” and when they all hear that she’s never pursued music because she thinks she doesn’t look the part, they pretty much want to throw things at her. But, like, in a good way – in a she is deserving of pursuing her dream kind of way. She’ll get to do just that in Hollywood. Makayla Brownlee, 17, Wellington, Kan.“Travelin’ Soldier” by the Dixie Chicks“Little Kansas snake hunter, you’re going to Hollywood” is a real sentence that was uttered and not just Luke Bryan playing mad libs. Makayla is a country girl through and through, all the way to her “sweet and sincere” country voice. It’s actually shocking to hear such a delicate, haunting voice come out of Makayla’s mouth, but that’s her, folks! Lionel tells her that her “magic trick” is the natural “country yodel cry” she has, and she should definitely keep picking songs that take advantage of that. Luke warns her that the female country artist contingent is strong this year, so she needs to be prepared, but he believes she can get in there and battle with the best of them. Amber Fiedler, 23, Coeur D’Alene, Idaho“Trust In Me” by Etta JamesAMBER. Amber is 38 weeks pregnant, but as she explains to the judges, she is giving the baby up for adoption. She’s had a tough life – her own mother battled with drugs – and isn’t at all ready to be a parent, so she’s found a family who can give this child a better life. She says it all very matter-of-factly and it is very moving and mature. But can we also talk about her singing? The greatest thing about this audition is that is just gets better and better. She has complete control and confidence in her voice, so she doesn’t mind waiting to really open up and knock our faces off. It’s effortless and “timeless,” Luke says. It’s the perfect way to end the audition rounds. Hey friends, you want to know something great? Now we’re all going to Hollywood! The Hollywood Week promos promise more twists and crying than ever before. That’s something to look forward to, right?

Jackson in an eyepatch. Marvel is headed to Disneyland, with the all-new Avengers Campus set to open in Disney California Adventure Park on July 18. The massive Marvel area is the latest addition to Disney’s ever-growing collection of attractions, coming just a year after the debut of its Star Wars-themed Galaxy’s Edge. And just as that space promised a ticket to an immersive galaxy far, far away, Avengers Campus will welcome visiting recruits into a small corner of the sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe. Last week, EW was among a handful of press outlets invited to tour the still-under-construction Avengers Campus and get the scoop on all things super. The opening is still several months away, and it shows: At the moment, hidden behind fences emblazoned with the Stark Industries logo, you’ll find little more than rough building shells, exposed beams, and scaffolding. But as you tromp through the mud, it’s hard not to imagine a Quinjet perched on top of that building, or Spider-Man swinging from that roof just overhead. This is Disney’s attempt to bring the world of Marvel off the screen, out of the comics, and into the real world. Marvel has had a Disneyland presence before, and as of right now, visitors can already meet heroes like Captain Marvel, Captain America, and Black Panther or ride the already-up-and-running Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout! (which replaced the old Tower of Terror several years ago). But Avengers Campus is something far more ambitious. The goal isn’t just to let you say hi to your favorite heroes; it’s to help you work alongside them and write your own comic-book-worthy origin story. Maybe you’ll help Peter Parker stop a swarm of skittering robots. Maybe you’ll go through the rigorous Dora Milaje training program. And maybe you’ll tap into your mystical side and learn some wizardry from Doctor Strange. This isn’t a top-secret, restricted facility like S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ. Avengers Campus is open to all, and they’re actively looking for new recruits (a.k.a. Disneyland visitors) to join their ranks and prove their heroism. Located where the old A Bug’s Land used to be in California Adventure, Avengers Campus is considerably smaller than Galaxy’s Edge, but it still squeezes in tons of Marvel geekery. The entire space is one cohesive area, divided into distinct zones: The Guardians of the Galaxy are already represented with Taneleer Tivan’s cosmic tower and Mission: Breakout, but there’s also the main Avengers building, a mystical outdoor Sanctum, the high-tech Pym Test Kitchen, and the newly established Worldwide Engineering Brigade, a.k.a. WEB. (During our tour, one Disney Imagineer compared it to a college campus, with several distinct fraternities and sororities.) Here, EW breaks down all the different areas and heroic opportunities, as well as what to expect when Avengers Campus officially opens its doors this summer. Meet your heroes (literally) at Avengers Headquarters Avengers Campus isn’t a meticulous recreation of places we’ve already seen on film; instead, it’s something totally new — and kind of old. The story goes that back in the 1940s, Tony Stark’s father Howard erected a Stark Motors factory here in California, and decades later, everyone’s favorite billionaire-playboy-philanthropist has transformed the site into a place for the Avengers to recruit and train young heroes. (Marvel loves a good acronym, so the “Campus” name stands for Centralized Assembly Mobilized to Prepare, Unite, and Safeguard.) The centerpiece is the massive, shiny headquarters, topped by a gleaming Quinjet. It’s similar in design to the HQ we’ve seen in the films, but this is its own, unique building. “That’s part of the reason why we wanted to create Avengers Campus as a brand-new place in the universe because then it doesn’t matter your level of fandom,” explains Jillian Pagan, staff writer for Walt Disney Imagineering. “You’re all coming in at the same level. You all can explore a brand-new place together.” There are embedded Easter eggs for the diehard fans who can name every Infinity Stone, as well as the newbies who don’t know their Iron Men from their Ant-Men. There will be plenty of heroes on hand, too: Visitors will be able to meet and interact with Iron Man, Spider-Man, Black Widow, Black Panther, Okoye and the Dora Milaje, Ant-Man, Wasp, Doctor Strange, Groot, Gamora, Star-Lord, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Thor, and Loki. A few of the heroes even dressed up specially for the occasion: Marvel Studios head of visual development Ryan Meinerding helped design a new, park-exclusive suit for Spider-Man and new Mark 80 armor for Iron Man. And since every superhero needs a villain, Avengers Campus will mark the debut of Taskmaster, the classic comics foe who’ll be joining the MCU in the upcoming Black Widow movie. The masked menace has a photographic memory and the ability to instantly copy his opponents’ fighting styles, and depending on when you visit, you may witness a dramatic showdown between the Avengers and Taskmaster on the roof of HQ. (Many of the stunts and fights were choreographed by the same fight coordinator team who worked on Black Widow.) “That guy has been bedeviling the Avengers for a really long time,” teases Dan Fields, executive creative director for Disney Parks Live Entertainment. “What a great foe to have to outthink and outfight and outmaneuver when he’s making an incursion here in the campus.” Of course, the presence of certain heroes raises the question: How can Iron Man or Black Widow be here, alive and well, when we last saw them, uh, dramatically kick the bucket in Avengers: Endgame? The answer is the same way Marvel’s been explaining continuity shenanigans in the comics for decades: Blame it on the multiverse! Avengers: Endgame hinges on the idea that you can go back in time and create alternate timelines and universes. Who’s to say that there isn’t another timeline where these particular heroes went west to California and opened Avengers Campus? “We diverge from the films in that we do kind of live in our own version of the multiverse,” Pagan explains. “We have some characters who maybe sadly have died and have sacrificed themselves in one part of the multiverse but are alive and well in our part of the multiverse. But we can still be informed and have that shared history with the events of the films.” Save the day with the Worldwide Engineering Brigade, a.k.a. WEB The Avengers aren’t the only heroic organization on Avengers Campus. One of the old brick buildings from Howard Stark’s automotive factory has been repurposed by the Worldwide Engineering Brigade — fittingly shortened to WEB. This exclusive, Stark-bankrolled club aims to unite some of the world’s brightest young minds and encourage them to invent new technologies. It’s here that young geniuses like Shuri and Peter Parker might dream up their next invention. If the main Avengers building is all shiny and chrome, WEB is considerably rougher around the edges. When we toured the site, it was still unfinished, but there were old Stark logos stenciled on the walls, and the brand-new brick was artificially weathered and cracked, as if it had been baking in the California sun for the last 80 years. WEB is also home to the campus’s main new attraction: an all-ages Spider-Man ride. Officially named “WEB Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure,” the ride lets visitors team up with Peter Parker to — you guessed it — sling webs and have an adventure. At first, riders enter the WEB building as if they’re there to attend an open house and learn more about the engineering team. Peter’s there showing off one of WEB’s recent inventions, a group of small, drone-like Spider-Bots — which immediately proceed to go haywire and start wreaking havoc. It’s up to riders to don 3D glasses, pile into small rotating cars called “WEB Slinger vehicles,” and start shooting some webs of their own to help catch the wayward bots. There are no buttons to press or blasters to shoot; every vehicle is equipped with brand-new motion-tracking tech, so all you have to do is extend your arm, the way Spider-Man does. (The Imagineers promise that it’s one of those things that’s hard to describe but will feel totally intuitive in person — so we’ll see.) “We wanted it to feel not like there was a special device that had these powers, but you had these special powers,” explains executive creative director Brent Strong. “Early on, our goal was: How do we make the interface disappear? How do we make the interface as transparent as possible, so it feels like you’re web-slinging, and not that you’re wielding a web-slinger?” When we visited, the Imagineers were coy about who might be voicing WEB Slinger’s version of Spider-Man, but since then, Disneyland’s announced that Tom Holland will be lending his voice to the ride. (He’s not the only MCU actor to make an appearance in the land, either: The Guardians of the Galaxy and the Collector himself, Benicio del Toro, already pop up during Mission: Breakout.) And although Spider-Man is the main hero hanging around WEB, comics fans might notice a few familiar names around the building. After all, a place like WEB would attract some of Marvel’s youngest and brightest engineering minds, so while you’re waiting in line, look for references to brilliant young comic heroes like Doreen Green (better known as Squirrel Girl) or the 9-year-old Lunella Lafayette (a.k.a. Moon Girl). Master the mystic arts in Doctor Strange’s Sanctum Much of Avengers Campus is all about the tech, but there’s also a place for the magical and unexplained. Hidden off the main path is an overgrown Sanctum, presided over by Doctor Strange himself. This is no Bleecker Street; this is an ancient temple imbued with magic, and many, uh, strange things happen here. For the Imagineers tasked with building it, it’s another example of taking an idea from the comics and films and exploring it in a totally different setting. “We’re not trying to rubber stamp something right out of the film,” explains Heidi Rosendahl, principal color and paint artisan. “We’ve kind of created our own Sanctum here, and an open, airy space — very much a contrast to the others that are brick and mortar-type facilities. Everything’s a little bit ethereal, and nature comes into play. It’s going to be a very beautiful transition between day and night.” Taste the future at the Pym Test Kitchen If visitors are looking for sustenance in between missions, they have a few options. Over by the Collector’s fortress, Taneleer Tivan himself has opened a stand called Terran Treats, which will feature all sorts of strange, alien edibles (like neon-colored churro spirals and cream puffs). Far more familiar will be the Shawarma Palace cart, a nod to the post-credits scene in 2012’s original Avengers movie. According to the Imagineers, Tony and friends couldn’t fathom the idea of heading west without access to their favorite post-Battle-of-New-York fast food joint, so they asked the restaurant’s owner to open a secondary location here on campus. But the main restaurant on campus is superhero-owned and operated. At the Pym Test Kitchen and adjacent Pym Tasting Lab, everything on the menu has been sized up or down using Ant-Man and the Wasp’s tech — think gargantuan candy bars or impossibly large meatballs. Even walking into the Test Kitchen is designed to feel a bit like walking into an enormous Quantum Tunnel, with its sleek, scientific design. Overhead, regular-sized pretzels zoom by on a conveyer belt, until they’re zapped with Pym Particles and emerge three times larger. There will also be plenty of beverage options, both alcoholic and otherwise. And in a nod to the oft-forgotten Incredible Hulk movie, the neon-green soda Pingo Doce will be for sale — hopefully, gamma radiation not included. (Read more about the Avengers Campus food and beverage options here.) All of this will be available when Avengers Campus opens its doors in July, but the Imagineers promise that they’re planning long past this summer. (Disney has previously teased a future interactive Avengers ride, set in Black Panther’s Wakanda.) By working with the Marvel Studios development teams, they’ve planted Easter eggs and references for films and Disney+ TV shows that won’t be released for years. “We always have endless ideas, and thankfully, there’s always more movies, there’s always more comic books,” executive creative director Brent Strong says. “We have more references and inspiration than you could ever hope for, so there’s no shortage of ideas. It’s just a matter of time before they all find their way off the page and into the park.” Related content: —All the Avengers Campus food and beverages, from Pingo Doce to shawarma —Disney unveils new Avengers, Spider-Man rides for Marvel park expansions —Disney to follow Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge theme park expansion with Marvel land", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "ew.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770708058, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "bb52a8b2c848cf0c24f2245e49fda1fb0583589f", "source": "reddit", "title": "15 years ago today Lady Gaga released “Born This Way”", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0sr3r", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "CityCautious4033", "score": 13, "comments": 3, "created_utc": 1770702836.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770708088, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "fc0f9ebaccd0e5a8bd58b8ab2c91cb2b4f5afe10", "source": "reddit", "title": "Blake Garrett, Child Actor in 'How to Eat Fried Worms,' Dead at 33", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0pmiv", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "Substantial-Dare5462", "score": 86, "comments": 6, "created_utc": 1770693557.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770708089, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "196ea8f7c4143f02a3666b8c88bd9643f8519e5e", "source": "reddit", "title": "Christina Applegate Invites Others with MS to Share 'the Good, the Bad, the Ugly…the Diapers' Through New Online Platform", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0ob39", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "PrincessBananas85", "score": 59, "comments": 5, "created_utc": 1770690030.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770708089, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "2b3ab93ad7e5f62e14ceb1cbb11aacd35d210cec", "source": "reddit", "title": "Remember when Mariah Carey was asked about Beyoncé and Jennifer Lopez back in the 2000s and if they had influence on her music?", "body": "", "heur": 60.0, "post_id": "1r0nenz", "subreddit": "popculturechat", "author": "onlyeveryotherday", "score": 194, "comments": 40, "created_utc": 1770687670.0, "mode": "new", "priority": 60, "url": "", "ts": 1770708089, "type": "item", "event_type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}, {"id": "2185f43677d2a3bc3d370ede930c9827502d324d", "source": "reddit", "title": "Chappell Roan has left  Wasserman agency amid founder-CEO’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein: “Artists deserve representation that aligns with their values and supports their safety and dignity.

As such, ***Send Help*** got to repeat at #1 for the second week in a row. Despite that, some films got to over-perform projections, including ***Solo Mio***, ***Stray Kids***, and ***Dracula***. The only big loser was ***The Strangers: Chapter 3***, which flopped to the surprise of absolutely no one.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $49 million this weekend. That's up 5.9% from last year, when ***Dog Man*** repeated at #1, and ***Heart Eyes*** and ***Love Hurts*** opened.\n\n20th Century Studios' ***Send Help*** remained at #1 with $9 million. That's a 53% drop, which isn't quite terrible considering Super Bowl deflated the weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned $34.8 million, and it seems like it should hit over $50 million domestically by the end of its run.\n\nFrom time to time, Angel Studios has a film that over-performs projections. It rarely happens, but this was that occassion, as the Kevin James-led ***Solo Mio*** managed to hit second place with $7 million in 3,052 theaters. Quite impressive, to be honest. Given strong reception, this could hit $20 million, assuming it's not consumed by the incoming releases.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Markiplier's ***Iron Lung*** saw a steep drop in its second weekend. It collapsed 63%, earning $6.7 million this weekend. Nevertheless, that's not actually a bad drop, considering other titles could drop as high as 70%. Through 10 days, the film has earned $31.5 million so far.\n\nBleecker Street's ***Stray Kids: The DominATE experience*** managed to hit fourth place with a great $5.6 million in 1,724 theaters. That's one of the studio's biggest ever debuts. Nevertheless, it's not gonna last long, given how front-loaded it was: 54% of the weekend's gross came from Friday.\n\nIn fifth place, Vertical's release of Luc Besson's ***Dracula*** debuted with $4 million in 2,050 theaters. That's not a lot of money, but it's Vertical's biggest ever debut. In fact, with just this weekend, ***Dracula*** is already Vertical's biggest film domestically, finally overtaking ***Gotti*** ($4.2 million). Although with some competition, it'd be a surprise if it lasted long in theaters.\n\n***Zootopia 2*** had the best drop in the Top 10, despite the Super Bowl's presence. It eased just 32% this weekend, adding $4 million. The film has earned a crazy $414.5 million domestically, and it's definitely gonna pass ***A Minecraft Movie*** ($424 million) to become 2025's highest grossing film.\n\nIn seventh place, Lionsgate's ***The Strangers: Chapter 3*** flopped with just $3.4 million in 2,565 theaters. That's a rough 41% drop from ***Chapter 2*** ($5.8 million), which was already 51% below ***Chapter 1*** ($11.8 million). \n\nAnother unsurprising result. For some reason, Lionsgate really believed that a ***Strangers*** trilogy would be an easy profit. And to be fair, they were correct; they're ultra-cheap films (a combined $20 million for the whole trilogy), so they'll probably make some slight profit. But what's clear is that there's absolutely zero good will left on this franchise. Each passing film has been worse received than the prior film, and it looks like they saved the absolutely worst for last.\n\nAccording to Lionsgate, 53% of the audience was male, and 32% was in the 25-34 demographic. Critics destroyed the film with a brutal 16% on RT, and the audience pretty much agreed. The audience gave the film a horrible \"D\" on CinemaScore, the worst in the franchise. Even for horror, that's a terrible grade. Given its low debut and the fact that it will be facing severe competition, it'd be a surprise if it made it past $8 million domestically. But at least this left a mark, for it'll be named in the \"worst trilogies of all time\" lists.\n\n***Avatar: Fire and Ash*** dropped 39%, adding $3.4 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $391.5 million.\n\nIn ninth place, Black Bear's ***Shelter*** dropped 55%, adding $2.4 million. Through 10 days, the film has earned a weak $10 million, and it doesn't have much left in the gas tank.\n\nRounding out the Top 10 was Amazon MGM's ***Melania***, falling all the way from the third spot. After its poor debut last week, the film also had the worst drop in the Top 10. It collapsed a poor 67%, earning just $2.3 million this weekend. Seems that despite the \"glowing\" word of mouth from its niche fans, the rest of the world was just fine ignoring it. Through 10 days, the film has earned a poor $13.3 million, and it will miss $20 million.\n\nJust outside the Top 10, another Amazon MGM title. ***Mercy*** continues fizzling out, dropping 59% and earning just $1.8 million. The film has earned a meager $22.6 million so far.\n\n***The Housemaid*** dropped 51% for a $1.7 million weekend. That takes its domestic total to $123.5 million.\n\nA24 expanded the Charli XCX mockumentary ***The Moment*** to 581 theaters, and it earned $1.6 million. That takes its domestic total to $2.2 million. \n\nA24's ***Marty Supreme*** dropped 51%, adding $1.3 million. The film has amassed $93.2 million, and it looks like it might fall short of hitting $100 million domestically.\n\nA24 released ***Pillion*** in 4 theaters, where it earned $241,769. That translates to a very strong $60,442 per-theater average. The film has already earned $1.5 million in the UK back in November, and it will continue expanding over the next few weeks.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Stray Kids: The dominATE Experience*** debuted with $14.2 million overseas, for a $19.9 million worldwide debut. The best debuts were in Mexico ($2.1M), Germany ($1.6M), the UK ($1.4M), Italy ($800K), Spain ($600K), Brazil ($600K), France ($500K), Peru ($400K), Chile ($400K), Australia ($400K), Argentina ($300K), and Poland ($300K). These are very impressive debuts, considering it didn't have a lot of screenings in some markets. If there's one place where it surprisingly flopped was Korea, with just $227K. \n\nWith $14.7 million overseas, ***The Housemaid*** has crossed $350 million worldwide. It's nearing $40 million in the UK, and $35.8 million in France.\n\n***Zootopia 2*** has hit another milestone. With $12.8 million overseas, it has crossed the $1.8 billion milestone worldwide. It's already the ninth highest grossing film worldwide, and the fifth biggest overseas.\n\n***Avatar: Fire and Ash*** added $12.2 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $1.439 billion.\n\n***Hamnet*** has added $6.8 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to a dazzling $70.6 million. Unsurprisingly, the UK has been its biggest market with $22.7 million, overtaking the domestic market. Given that it still has some markets left and with great holds, it definitely looks like the film has a chance to cross $100 million worldwide. A huge win for adult dramas.\n\n***Send Help*** has added $6.3 million overseas, crossing $50 million worldwide in the process. It debuted in the UK with a pretty good $2.2 million. Best markets are Mexico ($2.3M), the UK ($2.2M), Australia ($1.6M), Germany ($900K), Japan ($800K), Italy ($800k), Saudia Arabia ($700K), Spain ($700k), Netherlands ($600K) and Korea ($500K).\n\nWith $147 million worldwide, ***Marty Supreme*** has surpassed ***Everything Everywhere All At Once*** to become A24's highest grossing film. Let's see how high it can go.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Greenland 2: Migration* | Jan/9 | Lionsgate | $8,401,148 | $17,770,308 | $25,841,231 | $90M\n\n- Did you know there was a ***Greenland*** sequel in theaters? Or that there was a first ***Greenland*** movie in the first place? Cause ***Greenland 2: Migration*** has closed after just 4 weeks with an abysmal $25 million worldwide, failing to come anywhere close to its $90 million budget. Gerard Butler may be a recognizable name, but he sure has a lot of big flops to his name.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nIt's a very busy weekend, with FOUR films opening in wide release.\n\nThe buzziest title is WB's ***Wuthering Heights***, the new film from Emerald Fennell and starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi. An adaptation of the novel by Emily Brontë, although this will clearly take a lot of liberties with the story (after all, the title is in quotation marks). So far, everything has looked pretty good, and it's the kind of film that could strike a chord with audiences over St. Valentine's Day. Whatever happens after the weekend, however, it's up to word of mouth.\n\nSony is releasing their new animated film ***Goat***, following an anthropomorphic goat named Will Harris who aspires to become the greatest of all time at a basketball-like sport known as roarball. It marks Sony Pictures Animation's first theatrical release since ***Across the Spider-Verse***, and it should benefit from a 2-month absence of notable animated films. \n\nAmazon MGM is releasing crime thriller ***Crime 101***, starring Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Barry Keoghan, Monica Barbaro, Corey Hawkins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Nick Nolte, and Halle Berry. The movie looks like slick fun, but it remains to be seen if Hemsworth will turn his luck around, given that he has starred in a lot of failures outside the MCU.\n\nAnd finally, Gore Verbinski is returning after almost a decade with a new film, ***Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die***. The film stars Sam Rockwell, Haley Lu Richardson, Michael Peña, Zazie Beetz, Asim Chaudhry, Tom Taylor, and Juno Temple, and follows a man from the future who travels to the past and recruits the patrons of a Los Angeles diner he arrives in to help combat a rogue artificial intelligence. The film has great reviews on its side (93% on RT), but Briarcliff is not a great distributor for films.\n\n#**STREAMING DATA**\n\nHow did Netflix do last week?\n\nFigures for the week of January 26 to February 1:\n\nNo. | Movie | Year | Studio | Weeks in Top 10 | Views | Runtime | Hours Viewed\n----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n1 | *The Rip* | 2026 | Netflix | 3 | 14,600,000 | 1:53 | 27,500,000\n2 | *Kidnapped: Elizabeth Smart* | 2026 | Netflix | 2 | 9,600,000 | 1:31 | 14,500,000\n3 | *Dhurandhar* | 2025 | Jio Studios | 1 | 7,600,000 | 3:26 | 26,100,000\n4 | *KPop Demon Hunters* | 2025 | Netflix | 33 | 6,800,000 | 1:40 | 11,400,000\n5 | *The Big Fake* | 2026 | Netflix | 1 | 6,600,000 | 1:56 | 12,800,000\n6 | *Max* | 2015 | Warner Bros. | 2 | 6,200,000 | 1:51 | 11,400,000\n7 | *Trap* | 2025 | Warner Bros. | 1 | 5,400,000 | 1:45 | 9,400,000\n8 | *M3GAN 2.0* | 2025 | Universal | 1 | 5,000,000 | 2:00 | 10,000,000\n9 | *People We Meet on Vacation* | 2026 | Netflix | 4 | 4,500,000 | 1:58 | 8,900,000\n10 | *Tere Ishk Mein* | 2025 | AA Films | 2 | 4,400,000 | 2:45 | 12,100,000\n\nFor the third week in a row, ***The Rip*** has stayed at #1, with 14.6 million views.

For Fennell, it looks like a luxurious pose of unserious abandon. It’s quasi-erotic, pseudo-romantic and then ersatz-sad, a club night of mock emotion.\n\n[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/02/09/wuthering-heights-2026-movie-review/88556199007/) \\- 3.5 / 4\n\n&gt;Emerald Fennell’s take on the literary classic isn’t exactly a Valentine’s Day pick-me-up.

Even stranger, those who have fostered a distaste for the filmmaker’s sensibility will similarly find themselves disappointed.

Except she defies that assumption by making sure that although *“Wuthering Heights”* remains a deliciously horny film, it does summon a certain degree of pure romance, especially in the few moments when its leads are able to see past their misunderstandings and actually connect. It’s a movie about how ugly people can be to each other, but also about the beauty they’re capable of — a message that, like the original text itself, remains timeless.\n\n[The Telegraph - Robbie Collins](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2026/02/09/margot-robbie-jacob-elordi-wuthering-heights/) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;Style over substance? Not at all – it’s more that Fennell understands that style can be substance when you do it right.

The trailer alone evoked so much hand-wringing from Brontë purists that the film became divisive sight unseen. This Wuthering Heights *is* very true to Fennell, the director of the scathing revenge drama Promising Young Woman and the lush, bitter story of class and obsession, Saltburn.\n\n[Collider - Therese Lacson](https://collider.com/wuthering-heights-review-margot-robbie-jacob-elordi-emerald-fennell-emily-bronte/) \\- 2 / 10\n\n&gt;What makes the original Wuthering Heights so powerful is the dizzying story at its core. The Earnshaws and Lintons have a complicated family tree, and Heathcliff comes in like a wrecking ball to blow everything up. On one hand, we want to believe that Heathcliff can change from his wicked ways with enough love from Cathy, but on the other hand, his actions are so cruel that it feels like Brontë is pushing us to the very brink of what is acceptable before ultimately redeeming him in his final moments. Emily Brontë's novel is about characters who are hateful and pitiable but still full of enough charm and complexity that we are desperate to learn their full, messy tale.

If so, you’ve come to the right place this week. It’s spring cleaning time at NCIS, and Bishop is going all out. Bags and bags of clothes, mementos, accessories, all of it bound for a donation to the VA and all of it raising the eyebrows of her co-workers, who worry that she’s purging her whole life. Delilah, meanwhile, has put together a donation box that includes McGee’s favorite T-shirt, vintage Atari joystick, and ’80s action figure, which feels a little like the step before she hands him actual divorce papers. Worse, Gibbs swoops in and claims the shirt as a new shop rag, while Palmer manages to swipe the rest of McGee’s stuff for Kasie, who’s got her eye on the joystick. But charity donations aren’t driving the case of the week. That would be the murder of Petty Officer Third Class Noah O’Donnell, whose body was dumped in the road with execution-style gunshot wounds in his chest and head. Noah was an intelligence specialist at Quantico who taught self-defense in his spare time and lived with his sister Claire in the small town of Fillmore. The first person to attract NCIS attention is Det. John Fischer, who investigated the unsolved murder of Noah and Claire’s parents 10 years ago. He’s poking around Noah’s murder but trying to keep it quiet so the media attention doesn’t explode like it did during the popular The Fault in Fillmore podcast about the O’Donnell murders, which turned the town into a three-ring circus for weirdos. He’s overall cagey and hostile with NCIS and claims not to know where Claire’s hiding. But Fischer might be on to something. Like his parents, Noah was shot at close range execution-style, and like his parents, the bullets were removed from his body with long tweezers. Also, when the police found Noah and Claire the night of their parents’ murders, they were wandering in the road, which is exactly where Noah’s body was found. So do we have a copycat, or is the original killer back? The team next questions Paul Johansson, a tank of a man who taught self-defense at the same facility as Noah. He says Noah was well-liked, while Claire’s nothing but trouble: unable to hold a job and prone to wandering at night like a zombie. Noah moved in to keep an eye on her, but she dragged him down too. Next stop: the old O’Donnell house, where the murders happened a decade ago. It’s a condemned wreck, and Gibbs and Bishop are keenly aware of all the neighborhood eyes on them as they investigate. (Rule 35: Always watch the watchers!) In the backyard, they find a storage shed with a padlock that has Claire’s initials on it. Once they gain entry, they find a macabre workroom with crime scene photos everywhere and dollhouses that painstakingly recreate the murder scenes depicted. And yes, one of the dollhouses showcases Claire’s own parents’ murder. Back at NCIS, Ducky recognizes them as modern-day nutshells in the style of Frances Glessner Lee, who created a series of crime scene miniatures in the 1940s. Called the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death, they were intricate and beautifully rendered dollhouses that were used to train homicide detectives and forensics students to analyze crime scenes when the field was still in its infancy. Three of the dollhouses feature solved crimes, with the O’Donnell murder the only unsolved one. Sloane wonders aloud if Claire’s a hobbyist coping with trauma through true crime. Then again, NCIS found long-handled tweezers with Noah’s blood on them in Claire’s desk, so she may also have found a different coping mechanism. A talk with the head of the Historical Society Miniature Enthusiast Group reveals that Claire’s the most recent HSMEG member, and she’s fixated on her parents’ murder in part out of fear that the killer isn’t done with her family. Notoriety isn’t done with the family either; when news of Noah’s death hits the news, the O’Donnell house is swarmed by podcast fans there for Claire. The loudest women in the crowd are a goth and a cat sweatshirt aficionado, who remind NCIS that Claire always returns to the scene of the crime in her nocturnal wanderings. Ah, but tonight she has a new crime scene to visit. Gibbs heads straight to the stretch of road where Noah’s body was found, and there’s Claire, brandishing Noah’s gun for protection. Gibbs gently suggests that her parents would want her to come into the light, and he escorts her to NCIS for questioning. Vance, seeing a traumatized young woman who lost her parents, scampers off to call his kids. Claire starts things off by asking Gibbs, “Has anyone you love ever been killed?” (Oh dear. So many.) Then she says Noah was helping her solve their parents’ murders and must’ve uncovered something. “He’s dead because of me.” In fact, Noah did have an almost illegible evidence custody document on his body, and Claire has an alibi thanks to the #WheresClaire hashtag with photos of sightings that night placing her nowhere near Noah’s body. Time for a new suspect. At this point, Fischer storms NCIS, demanding to know why Claire’s being held. He tells Gibbs that he’ll never forget coming across the O’Donnell kids the night of the murders, and he spits out that the only reason he didn’t solve the case years ago was because a bureaucrat like Gibbs wouldn’t spare the budget to exhume the body of the transient man Fischer liked for the crime to compare it to a DNA sample. Gibbs takes another run at getting answers from Claire, which he does by proving his investigative chops on her nutshells: a murder/suicide stemming from a financial dispute. An acquaintance kidnapping. Robbery/arson/murder. That last one stops Claire short. It’s the nutshell that Noah built, although it was officially ruled an electrical fire thanks to bad wiring, not arson. “We’ve been looking into the wrong case,” Gibbs realizes. This new case involves the recently widowed Louise Fitzgerald, who was worth millions and found dead in her burned home. If Noah started to suspect murder, that points in a whole different direction. Specifically, it points toward the self-defense classes, which Louise attended with Noah… and his buddy Paul, whose day job is an electrician. Paul realizes the jig is up and tries to run, charging directly at Bishop. He’s easily twice her size and clearly intends to bowl her over and escape, but she drops and sweeps her leg in his path, taking him down. It’s … it’s impressive. In short order, we learn that Paul had gambling debts, so he stole from Louise, killed her, and set the fire to cover it up. When Noah asked for his input on how someone might stage an electrical fire, Paul killed him and tried to frame Claire. The case solved, Sloane urges Claire to make an appointment to start therapy with Grace Confalone, while Kasie tries to recruit Claire to join her in forensics. Claire declines but mentions that someone recently offered her $10,000 to build their daughter a dollhouse. OOOH, DO THAT, CLAIRE! Also, Ducky called in a favor and got an exhumation order for the suspect in the O’Donnell parents’ murder, so Claire heads off to meet with Fischer, hopeful that he can deliver the same justice she helped provide for Noah. In the final minutes of the episode, Bishop slides onto the Elevator of Schemes and Secrets with Gibbs and rather defensively tells him that she’s giving away all her things because she’s evolved and isn’t the same person that she was when she started. Gibbs doesn’t disagree, but he does remind her, “You can’t erase it all,” handing her the OSU Pistol Pete hat he plucked from her donation pile. Then Bishop gets a text from Odette that reads, “Tomorrow 6 a.m.” Who’s ready for secret agent Bishop, y’all? Stray shots Very cool episode tonight! While the podcast fandom could’ve been fleshed out into something bigger and more fun, the mystery itself and Claire’s sad story were well done, and the ambiguous ending leaves us with a little frisson of uncertainty. Will Claire ever find a resolution to her parents’ murders? Torres quote of the week: “Are you trying to tell me how to Kondo?” Hey, CBS, I’d watch a 24-episode series of people solving crimes based on nutshell dollhouses. Likewise, I would watch many seasons of Claire building gorgeous dollhouses and solving crimes. Either or both would be fabulous. Hit me up. Speaking of the nutshell dollhouses: Frances Glessner Lee is real and did, in fact, utilize a traditionally feminine craft to excel in the male-dominated world of law enforcement in the 1940s. If you want to learn more, this CBS News Sunday Morning piece is an excellent overview of her work.

Over the last decade, she’s evolved from morally conflicted superspy to avenging hero and, ultimately, the sacrificial savior of the universe. With Nat finally stepping into the spotlight for her own solo film, EW asked Johansson to look back on a key scene from every Black Widow appearance. Iron Man 2 (2010)The superspy made her MCU debut with a brutal hallway fight, knocking down bad guys and setting up her next decade on screen. “A lot of the moves are really spider-like, they’re balletic, and they pay homage to Natasha’s past,” Johansson explains. “I’m still doing a lot of those moves today, just a little bit more creaky.” Time comes for us all, even trained assassins. The Avengers (2012)One of Natasha’s key moments comes early in The Avengers, as she and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) verbally spar and try to wheedle information out of each other. It’s one of the audience’s first glimpses into Natasha’s past, and Johansson says the scene owes its back-and-forth energy to Avengers writer-director Joss Whedon. “It’s got this great dramatic intensity, and then it’s just super playful,” she adds. Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)Johansson and Captain America star Chris Evans first worked together a decade earlier in 2004’s The Perfect Score, and the actress says it’s their off-screen friendship that made scenes like this — where Steve and Nat — so effortless. “It’s really a result of 10 years of knowing somebody and being able to have a kind of intimacy with them that I think you get from just spending a lot of time with somebody and knowing their soft underbelly,” she says. Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)As a general rule, most spies dedicate their careers to putting up walls, but this Age of Ultron moment with Mark Ruffalo‘s Bruce Banner is a rare moment of vulnerability for Nat. As for the scene itself — in which Natasha opens up about her forced sterilization and inability to have children — filming it required a bit of movie magic. “ ironic because I was also really pregnant at the time,” Johansson adds with a laugh. Captain America: Civil War (2016)Until Infinity War united its heroes for the fight against Thanos, 2016’s Civil War held the record for the most Avengers in one place, thanks to its climactic airport runway battle. On the days Johansson shot the scene in Atlanta, the temperature of the tarmac soared above 100 degrees — but the result, she says, was worth it. “I remember both sides running at each other, full speed charging at each other, and you knew that the universe would be forever changed after that.” Avengers: Infinity War (2018)The final Wakanda battle in Infinity War sees Natasha teaming up with Elizabeth Olsen‘s Scarlet Witch and Danai Gurira‘s Okoye to take down Proxima Midnight (Carrie Coon). “We were just this random other unit that was fighting in a ditch for like weeks,” Johansson says with a laugh. “When Lizzie came along, we were like, ‘And where have you been! You get to do the awesome hero pose, and we’ve been eating dirt for three weeks!'” Avengers: Endgame (2019)Nat’s final hero moment, where she sacrifices herself for the Soul Stone, was originally filmed as a chase scene with an “army of Dementor-type creatures,” Johansson reveals. “I was thinking, ‘Parents will never forgive us for how these creatures look.'” But the sequence felt too busy in an already action-packed film, so she and Jeremy Renner later reshot it as a quieter, more emotional confrontation. “We wanted to leave with the weight of that loss and the shock of it,” Johansson says. Black Widow (2020)Audiences at 2019’s San Diego Comic-Con were treated to an early cut of this scene from the solo Black Widow movie, where Nat reunites with her “sister,” Florence Pugh‘s Yelena Belova — and they proceed to beat the crap out of each other. (It was also one of the first scenes Pugh and Johansson shot together, and it forced them to get up close and personal fast.) “It’s like when you see prize fighters who have come together to have a second go at it, and you know that there’s all that built-up tension in a good kind of way,” Johansson explains. BONUS SCENE: The Avengers (2012)One of Johansson’s personal highlights is the moment the Avengers, well, assembled, for the now-iconic 360-degree shot during the Battle of New York. “I remember all of us assembling in that circle and looking around,” she explains. “All of us had a moment where we were like, ‘Oh. This is going to work.’” To read more on Black Widow, pick up the new issue of Entertainment Weekly beginning on Tuesday, March 17, or buy it here now.

And three months ago I made my biggest mistake and cheated on her,' the 28-year-old lamented. \n\nThe Olympian explained that he had told his girlfriend about his infidelity a week ago.\n\nLægreid went on to say that it had been 'the worst week of my life,' before tearfully declaring: 'I had a gold medal in my life...I only have eyes for her. I don't know what I want to achieve by saying this...I wish I could share it with her.'\n\nThe Olympian went on to say that he wanted to be a 'good role model', but that 'I have to admit when I make mistakes. \n\n'You have to admit when you do something you can't stand for, and hurt someone you love so much.'\n\nLægreid could be seen crying on camera as he made his shocking confession. \n\nAfter calming down, the biathlete continued, telling the NRK broadcaster he was willing to drop a metaphorical 'nuclear bomb' during the interview to try and win his girlfriend back. \n\n\n'Because I am already hated by her, and I hope that maybe it can make her realise how much I love her,' he added. \n\nWhen asked about the identity of his girlfriend, the sportsman refused to reveal her name out of respect. \n\n'She's probably still processing last week's message, but I hope there's light at the end of the tunnel for both of us. And that she can still love me,' he declared.\n\nLægreid revealed that he decided to go public about his infidelity the night before his big race, telling the television channel: 'Last night I had a kind of revelation that I should drop this bomb... Then we'll see what happens. I have nothing to lose.' \n\nLægreid's teammate, Johannes Dale-Skjevdal, later revealed to the broadcaster that the bronze medalist had told him about his infidelity, saying: 'We have known that, yes. I don't have many comments about it now.

Hair drawn back in a tidy braid, she barely glances down at Natasha Romanoff’s familiar black catsuit as she buckles every buckle and zips every zipper with rhythmic efficiency. Squeezed into a closet-size armory on a Manhattan Beach soundstage, Johansson’s assassin-turned-Avenger is surrounded by all the guns, knives, and glossy wigs a superspy could ever need. She moves like she’s been doing this for a decade — because she has. But this is something new: There’s no Captain America or Hawkeye to assist her, no S.H.I.E.L.D. backup waiting out of sight. This is Black Widow’s long-awaited solo movie, set in the turmoil between the all-star superhero team’s breakup in 2016’s Captain America: Civil War and their reunion in 2018’s Avengers: Infinity War. The mission she’s prepping for is personal, as the former Russian agent is going up against opponents from her past. When a fellow Widow, Rachel Weisz’s Melina, wonders how they’ll tackle one particularly formidable foe, Natasha replies, “Just get me close to him.” It’s not an arrogant quip or a self-congratulatory boast, just a matter-of-fact threat from a spy who is very, very good at her job. Then, just as Johansson pulls on her last glove with a satisfying snap…darkness. The studio has lost power; in the dark, someone calls out for flashlights. After a quick investigation, the production crew discovers the blackout is not the work of a diabolical supervillain but a blown transformer nearby. Natasha’s mission will have to wait a little while longer — but that’s all right. Black Widow knows how to wait. When Johansson made her debut as Black Widow in 2010’s Iron Man 2, the then-nascent Marvel Cinematic Universe was more like a small galaxy. Today, it stands as the most profitable film franchise of all time, a sprawling, 20-plus-film juggernaut that’s demolished box office records and turned obscure comic characters into marquee names. Among them is Romanoff, the scarlet-haired superspy without superpowers. Johansson’s portrayal became an immediate fan favorite, thanks to her sarcasm and general penchant for ass-kicking, plus her dramatic evolution — she goes from playing Tony Stark’s undercover personal assistant to Avengers founding member to savior of the universe. Now, after 10 years and seven movies, this spider is finally playing solitaire. Cate Shortland directs the Black Widow stand-alone film (out May 1), a prequel that follows Nat before — spoiler alert! — she sacrificed herself to thwart Thanos in last year’s Avengers: Endgame. The Natasha we’ve known has usually preferred to look ahead instead of behind: First trained to be a killer as a young girl in the secret Soviet Red Room program, she worked as an assassin and KGB agent on some less-than-heroic missions. She’s since devoted her life to more virtuous pursuits, whether that’s foiling alien invasions (several times) or teaching Hulk self-care. Now she’s forced to reexamine her history — and past trauma — when she’s drawn into a Red Room-related conspiracy. “I thought it was interesting to explore this part of her life before she rejoins the Avengers, before she makes that ultimate sacrifice,” Johansson, 35, explains. “How does she become this full person from all these broken pieces?” Johansson — a recent double Oscar nominee for Jojo Rabbit and Marriage Story — says she and Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige first discussed a potential solo film during the press tour for 2012’s The Avengers, as just “a tiny speck of an idea.” As fellow Avengers like Thor and Captain America got stand-alone sequels and threequels, Natasha continued to evolve within the main MCU story line until her death in Endgame, a noble finale for a character who dedicated her hero career to trying to right past wrongs. “We had been planning the conclusion for the Infinity Saga for the past five or six years, and Natasha’s journey within those films took the priority,” Feige explains. “The notion of breaking out for a stand-alone film that takes place in the past, for a character that we already knew and were already following, didn’t feel right.” Even as journalists and fans repeatedly asked Johansson when Black Widow would be going solo, the actress was privately unsure whether that was something she even wanted. “I was like, I think I’m good,” Johansson admits. “If we going to do this, it had to be creatively fulfilling. I’ve been working for such a long time, and I have to feel like I’m challenged. I don’t want to do the same thing that I’d already done before.” What changed her mind was a meeting with Shortland, an Australian director known for her introspective, female-fronted indies like 2004’s Somersault. “We just bonded over stories about trust and about intimacy and about women surviving,” Shortland says of that initial chat. “You didn’t have to be a superhero to identify with a woman who has had a really tough childhood and has survived and has a huge heart and helps other people.” Shortland — the first solo female director in the MCU’s history — hadn’t planned to pivot to superhero movies, but she was intrigued by Black Widow’s resilience (and lack of superpowers). Says Weisz, 50: “Even though this is a fantastical universe, the way Cate directs, I think it’s quite real.” “When I looked at the past films, there’s a lot of sitting outside of the character, so that she is seen and kind of objectified,” Shortland adds. “Oftentimes we don’t really get to see who she is when she’s by herself — who she is when she takes off the action-hero facade.” Much of Black Widow peels away that facade. Over the years, Marvel has sprinkled in cryptic allusions to Nat’s past — a reference to Budapest here, a Red Room flashback there — but the new film dives deeper. “A prequel that simply filled in the blanks of things you already know is not very exciting,” Feige says. “How does she get her Widow stingers for the first time? How did she learn to do a flip? That doesn’t matter.” What does matter is the people surrounding Natasha and how they helped shape her sense of self. With the Avengers AWOL, she turns to the only other kin she’s ever had: a hodgepodge band of Russian spies who went undercover together as a family when Natasha was a child. There’s Weisz as the mysterious Melina, who also trained as a Widow. There’s Florence Pugh (who’s also a recent Oscar nominee) as Yelena Belova, a no-nonsense Red Room alum whom Nat views as an estranged little sister. (Like many sisters, they settle differences by beating the crap out of each other.) And there’s David Harbour as Alexei, a.k.a. the Red Guardian, the Russian answer to Captain America (if Cap was a bearded, past-his-prime goofball). “I thought it would be a straightforward action movie, and then it wound up being a real character study of a dysfunctional family,” Harbour, 45, says. To play that familial bond, the cast had to get close — really close. Johansson and Pugh had met only a few times before they filmed their first scene together: a brutal smackdown between Natasha and Yelena, who haven’t seen each other in years. “Immediately we were in each other’s space, like, ‘All right, I’m going to grab your armpit, and you put your hand under my knee in a pretzel,’” Johansson recalls. “I remember thinking at the time, ‘That is one way of getting to know one another,’” Pugh, 24, adds with a laugh. The Avengers may have a diverse female roster now, but in 2010, Black Widow was the MCU’s only female Avenger. Now, with films like Captain Marvel and Wonder Woman topping the box office, a woman-led superhero flick is far less of a novelty. For Johansson, it’s a welcome shift, and although it’s been gradual, she says she felt it most while filming Infinity War and Endgame, battling aliens alongside Danai Gurira’s Okoye and Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch, or watching Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel step on set for the first time. “For anyone who said to me, ‘Oh, this should’ve happened five or 10 years ago,’ I’m like, it would not have been as substantial. We just would not have been able to do it. This film is happening now as a result of what’s going on in the zeitgeist, and I think it’s pretty cool.” The key, Johansson argues, is not just casting female heroes but telling distinctly female stories. (She remembers being told once that the Black Widow movie “could be like Bourne, but with a woman.”) “I think this character’s strength really lies in her vulnerability and her acceptance of that,” she says. “She has emotional intelligence that has allowed her to survive without any real superpowers. She’s someone who is a problem-solver. She’s a pragmatic person. I think a lot of those qualities are inherently female.” And although Natasha may have met her end at the bottom of that cliff on Vormir, Johansson wants her legacy to live on. “I hope that this film continues pushing that boundary, so that we can actually have more female superheroes who are inherently female, and aren’t just Batman in heels or whatever,” she adds. In the meantime, Johansson has to finish this female-superhero movie. As the release date nears, she and Shortland have been in the edit bay making last-minute tweaks. This film marks the first time Johansson has taken on an executive-producer role for the MCU, and she admits that she feels protective over Nat and how her story is received. “When we did San Diego Comic-Con , I remember being so scared and nervous,” Pugh recalls of taking the stage with Johansson. “And when we came off the stage we held hands, and she was just as nervous.” For its star, Black Widow is the culmination of a decade-long effort; and, as Johansson points out, Natasha isn’t the only one who’s changed over the years. “This film is very much a result of that journey, my own personal journey,” she says. “I feel that I probably wasn’t as willing or able to go to the kind of uncomfortable, embarrassing, ugly places before. I think it’s just as you get older, you trust yourself more.” After all, sometimes spies get the best results not by donning disguises but by stripping them away. “Maybe I wouldn’t even have been as curious about that part of before,” Johansson says. “Maybe I would’ve been more interested in wearing all these masks, and now I’m more interested in what’s behind them.” To read more on Black Widow, pick up the new issue of Entertainment Weekly beginning on Tuesday, March 17, or buy it here now.

Let’s see who inspired Blake Shelton, John Legend, Nick Jonas, and Kelly Clarkson enough to give up some precious spots on their teams. Anaya Cheyenne, 16, Atlanta, Ga. // “I’ll Never Love Again”This child has her own theme song, what more does she need?! I mean, I guess a spot on The Voice would be nice after moving away from her mother to pursue music and performing arts in Atlanta. But still, a theme song! Anaya starts out a little hesitant but holy hell if this girl doesn’t do runs that basically hit every single note in existence. Blake waits to see if Kelly is going to turn for this big-voiced pop vocalist — clearly, her wheelhouse — and then turns as soon as she does. He tries to sell his “sometimes the best artist-coach combos are the ones that don’t make sense” line but everyone else is like, um, you should really be with Kelly if you have pipes like that.Coach: Team Kelly, of course. Mandi Thomas, 33, Memphis, Tenn. // “Time To Say Goodbye” It’s a real blind and it is AN OPERA SINGER. Kelly Clarkson’s prayers have been answered. None of the other judges even want to touch Mandi because they have no idea how to handle a voice like hers, so Kelly, thankfully, doesn’t have to fight for this classically trained singer. Mandi can sing anything but wanted to show off something different. Her voice is a true instrument, so it’ll be interesting to see what songs Kelly and Mandi choose in later rounds and how she holds her own against more contemporary-sounding artists.Coach: Team Kelly is two-for-two tonight! Ari Tibi, 27, Calabasas, Calif. // “The Joke” Our third female vocalist in a row hails from a female trio folk-pop band. You can tell she’s polished and comfortable up there on stage, but the performance is lacking an emotional connection and there are some sour notes throughout. All of the judges are basically like, yeah, you’re obviously talented, but you could do this song much better. They all want her to come back again. That’s some positive feedback in a less-than-positive situation.Coach: n/a Jacob Miller, 29, Eden, Wis. // “The Times They Are a-Changin'” Oh, friends, I’m excited about this one. Jacob is a songwriter and performer who plays ragtime and jazz and thinks his musical tastes would fit better in the 1920s than today. Also, he’s insane on the guitar. He’s got a great sound that will really stand out on this show. Please, please The Voice, don’t ruin him. Kelly, Blake, and Nick all turn. Kelly would love to bring his sound to new audiences by blending with contemporary music. Blake wants to protect what Jacob does at all costs. And Nick mainly sounds interested in working with him so that he can collaborate with the Jonas Brothers. An interesting pitch tactic!Coach: Against all odds, Jacob joins Team Nick! Jacob Jonas it is, I guess. Jon Mullins, 32, Nashville, Tenn. // “Don’t Give Up On Me”Jon is a full-time musician in Nashville and three years ago, his wife suffered brain injuries after a fall. They’re on the other side of it now, but this is all for her — and you can feel that extra-emotion in Jon’s performance. This guy’s voice is so commercial and he has such a big, beautiful range, I’m surprised he ends up being a one-chair turn. And it’s not just any one chair. It’s a Blake Shelton one chair. Being a Nashville guy, Jon seems pretty pumped about it and is beyond grateful to be “on the team with the king.” Blake will never let being called the king go. He has been coronated, it is decided. The crowd chants “King Blake,” he is our master now.Coach: Team Blake, baby. Jacob Daniel Murphy, 27, Elk Grove, Calif. // “Until You Come Back to Me (That’s What I’m Gonna Do)” Well, at the very least, Blake is becoming the King of One Chair Turns. Incredible, Jacob Daniel Murphy completely THROWS DOWN on this song, with a big range and lots of connection, and no one turns until the very end when Blake finally goes. He explains that he assumed he’d have no chance and so wasn’t going to bother, but when he saw no one was going, he felt like he was “robbing a bank.” Blake is impressed with Jacob’s great pitch, big range, and controlled runs. It might not be a likely pairing, but we know how Blake feels about those.Coach: Another easy pickup for Team Blake. Zan Fiskum, 22, Seattle, Wash. // “Light On” Zan lives in an RV in her parents’ backyard as she tries to make a living as a musician. I love Zan. She’s very much in the indie-pop/folk world and she owns it. Her voice is clear and precise, and as John notes, she somehow has both power behind her vocals and can easily slip into a more ethereal vibe. She’s both polished and able to connect emotionally. She’s a great get for any team, which is why Kelly, Nick, and yes, John Legend in his first chair turn of the night, all fight for her. Zan makes it look effortless, and everyone wants someone like that on their team.Coach: This could go any way, but in the end, Zan feels like John would be the best fit for her style, so she joins Team Legend. Chan Fuze, 23, Chicago, Ill. // “Groove Me” Dang, Kelly Clarkson is so right: The Voice is just not the right settling for Chan to thrive. This man is 6-foot-10, rocks a velvet button-down like he was born in it, and has some moves. Unfortunately, none of this matters when the coaches can’t see you. Poor Chan here gets zero chair turns. Blake thinks that there was too much emphasis on the showman part of the performance and not enough on the singing. John doesn’t think Chan’s falsetto was “as effective” as it needed to be. None of this gets Chan down though, he is still a party in human form.Coach: n/a Roderick Chambers, 38, Miami, Fla. // “Back At One” When Roderick started off with the Brian McKnight JAM, both Kelly and I jumped. More Brian McKnight on this show, please! Roderick has been a musician for most of his life, he was in a group with his brother when he was younger, but has since been living as a solo musician in Miami. It’s not the most dynamic audition we’ve seen this evening, but Nick is right — Roderick has a voice that could sound great on anything. John compares Roderick’s tone to Nick’s, so maybe this one-chair turn is working out for the best.Coach: It’s Team Nick always and forever here. Jules, 15, Peoria, Ariz. // “Ain’t No Rest for the Wicked” Jules is only 15 but has been playing guitar since she was six, and gigging since she was 12. That is a hard-working teenager, you guys! It shows because Jules walks up on stage with a lot of confidence — she does her own arrangement on this song to set herself apart. Her poor dad looks like he might pass out at any moment and he has to wait until the very end to find some relief. Both Blake and Kelly turn at the last minute. Kelly loves that a 15-year-old girl has such control over her lower register and can’t believe she has such a mature voice for being so young. Blake says something about the Arizona Cardinals.Coach: Her family is pushing Blake, but Miss Independent joins Team Kelly (you’re welcome!). Jared Harper 22, San Francisco, Calif. // “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” Jared, who is deaf in his right ear, was inspired by Maelyn Jarmon and is here on The Voice to take the next step in his music career. Unfortunately, he never really connects with the song and ends up with no chair turns. Blake was waiting for the energy to be kicked up a notch and both he and John note some pitch problems that made them hesitant to turn.Coach: n/a Michael Williams 18, Mason, Ohio // “You Say” Look at this little cutie! Michael has a digestive disorder and, at one point, never expected to feel well enough to perform again. He’s got a big range but doesn’t quite hit the high note in his falsetto — which is exactly why Nick Jonas turns his chair for him. Nick had to work long and hard on his falsetto and he wants to get Michael’s into shape. Nick is really winning me over with pitches like this. He’s giving this kid a chance!Coach: Team Nick, but sing it in falsetto. Mike Jerel, 31, Ashburn, Ga. “It’s A Man’s, Man’s, Man’s World”The Voice clearly saved the best for last tonight. After a whole slew of one-chair turns, we’re ending the evening with a four-chair turn, baby. Everyone wants a piece of Mike Jerel. Oh, you guys, he is SO GOOD. There’s intensity and emotion and complete control of both his voice and the piano. The place goes crazy. Honestly, has John Legend ever been this excited about a potential artist joining his team? Everyone assumes Mike is going to pick John, but holy hell do they fight anyway. Kelly’s pitch is particularly, at least momentarily, persuasive: She makes sure Mike knows that on John’s team, he’ll be fighting for spots with every other singer who plays piano on this show, but she has no male artists and no pianists on her team. It’s all him. None of this matters though because Mike’s mom wants him to pick John.Coach: Team Legend — come on, you can’t go against mom.

Now people have options and theyre choosing web series over movies. bollywood is FINISHED\n\nThe writing difference is insane. Bollywood still doing hero introduction slow motion, item song, interval twist, climax fight - SAME FORMULA SINCE 1990.\n\nMeanwhile Sacred Games, Paatal Lok, Delhi Crime have actual complex characters and proper stories. OTT writers get 8-10 episodes to develop plot vs bollywood cramming everything in 2.5 hours with 6 songs that nobody asked for.\n\nCan we talk about casting?? Bollywood giving films to ananya pandey and star kids who cant act. Web series made stars out of actual talented people like Jaideep Ahlawat and Pratik Gandhi, and i can list many names here.\n\nTalent over connections, what a revolutionary concept.\n\nThe censorship freedom is huge too. bollywood cant show reality because censor board cuts everything for \"sanskaar\". Web series show actual life, use real language, tackle controversial topics. That is the reason OTT feels REAL, bollywood feels like fake sanitized garbage made for 5 year olds\n\nWomen characters in OTT actually make sense as human beings instead of just item girls or bechari victims waiting for hero to save them. Shefali Shah in Delhi Crime got lead role bollywood would never give her. Kubbra Sait in Sacred Games played complex gray character.\n\nbudget usage is smarter too. bollywood spends 200 crores - 100 crore on star salary, 50 crore on foreign locations nobody cares about, whatever left on actual film.\n\nScam 1992 cost fraction of Thugs of Hindostan budget but guess which one people actually remember and rewatch?? OTT spends money on production quality and writing not just star faces.\n\nthe variety is unmatched. Bollywood makes 90% love stories and 10% action, thats it. OTT in last 2 years alone gave us office politics, cybercrime, small town life, stock market scams, mythology, sports corruption, CAT exam struggles - something for literally everyone\n\nEven big bollywood stars choosing OTT now. Saif, Abhishek, Madhavan doing their best work in web series because better scripts and creative freedom. Nawazuddin and Manoj bajpayee became STARS through OTT after bollywood ignored them for decades\n\nThe numbers dont lie either. Bollywood films flopping one after another - shamshera, laal singh chaddha, raksha bandhan all disasters.\n\nMeanwhile Scam 1992 got 9.6 on imdb and became cultural phenomenon. Panchayat, Mirzapur, Family Man bigger than most bollywood releases. Delhi Crime won international emmy while bollywood still begging for oscar attention\n\nBollywood always said \"audience wants masala only\" and \"content films dont work\" but OTT proved this completely wrong. People WANT good content, they just dont want bollywood's garbage.\n\nYounger generation can name 10 web series but cant name 5 recent bollywood films.\n\nHard truth is bollywood survived on monopoly. OTT broke that monopoly and exposed them. without captive theater audience forced to watch whatever releases, people choosing better content. Star worship era is OVER, content is king now, and bollywood still stuck in 1995 formula\n\nhonestly they deserve this after decades of treating audience like idiots, nepotism, exploitation, formula films.\n\nPlus, i know there are lots of good bollywood movies as well but then why they dont have box office collections.

I dig the imperfections you can get. On Ghostbusters I think the beams from their proton packs look better in the first two films than in any of the recent ones where it’s digital. It looks more interesting. Like rubberized light. The digital look often can seem too clean. Too perfect. \n\nAs for traditional animation of cel done with ink and paint? Man. Look at the beauty in the Max Fleischer Superman shorts or the old WB looney tunes cartoons. On TV the first 6-7 seasons of the Simpsons just look so warm and inviting. The yellow has a contrast to it and Homer going off model actually served the comedy sometimes, his eyes especially.\n\nAs all the older FX and animation masters get old and pass away, all the knowledge and training goes with them.

He’s looking for the perfect, vintage… Shotput? Workout accessory? Bludgeoning device? A diverse collection of objects is put to the heft test: a TV, a teakettle, a kettlebell. A mallet. A typewriter. A Buddha sculpture. A bowling ball? No, even better: three bowling balls. We’ll have to wait until much later to find out the purpose of Jimmy’s shopping excursion. For now, we cut to the title credits and then to Jimmy and Kim’s apartment. There’s a half-eaten pizza sitting on the coffee table, and the couple is asleep and nude — but between the pizza and the pair of Jimmy’s shoes that are propped atop each other in a way that suggests removal by a very, very drunk person, the whole vibe is distinctly unsexy. Less post-coital bliss, more the kind of naked where you wake up with a mouth that tastes like a trash can and no memory of having removed your clothes. Kim is determined to clean up the mess she made, starting with the busted beer bottles she chucked into the parking lot last night. While she sweeps, she consults with her assistant about property records for the Mesa Verde call center in Tucumcari — clearly formulating a plan, confident that she can fix things. Jimmy, meanwhile, has an appointment with the ambiguously dumb duo previously seen painting the town red in “50% Off.” This meeting plays out pretty much as you’d expect: of course the guys thought they could pay Jimmy’s fee with the money they stole, and of course they have no other funds. One of them has a grandma he can hit up for cash, which Jimmy tells him to do — and that’s it for now, but probably not for good. (What are the chances that the grandma in question is someone Jimmy knows from his previous life as an honest elder law attorney? What are the chances this ends well? Discuss.) From there, Jimmy heads to the only nice restaurant in town (or at least the only one we ever see), where we find out what Howard Hamlin has been up to since last season. Over drinks, Howard asks Jimmy some cursory questions about Saul Goodman, but it’s Jimmy he really wants — as an employee. Ah, yes: all it took was a series of ridiculous scandals and the tragic suicide of one of the firm’s namesakes, but Howard Hamlin has finally decided that he wants his boy, “Charlie Hustle,” on the roster at HHM, and the only thing more fascinating than the barely-masked resentment on Jimmy’s face is that Howard somehow doesn’t see it. He’s so distracted by the shiny prospect of his own redemption, finally being the good guy, that he’s blind to the fact that it’s much too little, much too late. But just in case you’re not sure how you’re supposed to feel about Howard in this scene, do enjoy the too-long, too-close hug he gives Jimmy before driving away in his valet-parked sports car with a vanity plate that says… NAMAST3. This, too, will not end well. While Howard Hamlin drives off into the sunset, Saul Goodman has an afternoon in court, defending a client accused of robbery, and Kim shows up to watch the action just as a Mr. Harkness takes the witness stand. (Fun fact: Although his name didn’t appear in the credits, that’s definitely Tim de Zarn, the wonderful character actor who played Mordecai the Harbinger of Doom in Joss Whedon’s Cabin in the Woods.) Harkness points to the bearded man sitting at the defense table: There’s the robber, he says. Your client. Jimmy pushes him: Is he sure? Did he really get a good look? The witness insists that yes, it’s the man at the defense table who robbed him, at which point Jimmy reveals that the guy at the defense table… isn’t his client. Ha! The real Slim Shady stands up — he’s been seated in the gallery while a doppelganger with similar facial hair took his place at the defense table — and the whole courtroom erupts. “Mr. Goodman!”, the judge scolds, and Jimmy grins, totally in his element. “You didn’t recognize him either, your Honor.” These are the sort of courtroom antics that have always made Kim uncomfortable, but this time, they’re exactly what she’s here for. Earlier, we saw her try and fail to convince Mesa Verde to choose another location (read: one not already occupied by a cantankerous senior citizen) for their call center. If she wants to do right by Mr. Acker, she’d better call… you-know-who. Some time later, Saul Goodman knocks at the door of Acker’s home and presents him with a proposal for legal services, and by “proposal,” we mean “a picture of a man having sex with a horse.” But it’s a metaphor: Saul is the man, Mesa Verde is the horse, and — once again, and much like man-on-horse carnal relations — this probably won’t end well, either. Not for the horse, but also not for the horse’s lead counsel. Meanwhile, it’s time for yet another crowd-pleasing cameo from everyone’s favorite DEA agents, as Hank and Steve stake out a dead drop to see if Krazy-8’s information is good. The scene is intercut with a tense interaction at Los Pollos Hermanos, as a stressed-out Gus waits for the phone to ring and passes the time by terrorizing his kitchen manager over an inadequately-maintained deep fryer, but let’s be real, it’s Hank’s ambient musing about the etymology of the word “culvert” that really brings the drama here. At the end of the night, the DEA has bagged nearly a million bucks in drug money and arrested several low-level guys — all according to Gus Fring’s plan. (Also, in case you were wondering, the origins of “culvert” are unknown, but the Dutch word for crotch rot is “kruis rot.”) It went down like it was supposed to. That’s what Victor tells Gus after the DEA raids the dead drops, but it feels more broadly true. This whole episode has a sense of doors closing and destinies taking shape. Jimmy, finally given the chance to come aboard at the firm that already bears his name, doesn’t just decline the offer; he pitches a bowling ball through the back window of Howard Hamlin’s car. (Namaste!) Kim, instead of saying a serenity prayer and getting on with her work, sets up her biggest client for a humiliating setback in court. But at the very end, all this inevitability is balanced out by mystery: Mike, still spiraling over Werner’s death and his unresolved guilt over Matty, goes out once again looking for a fight — and wakes up on a goat farm in the middle of nowhere. Where is he? How did he get there? And most importantly, to whom does he now owe his life?

These are the existential questions that pose themselves aboard the Avenue 5, where focus has finally turned away from the constellation of glowing turds orbiting the ship, and back to the actual s—show happening inside it. Since realizing that shedding the weight of 500 people could cut their ETA to Earth down from three-and-a-half years to six months, Karen has started coordinating the collection of non-essential items to toss in lieu of the original tossing plan from a few episodes ago: her husband, Frank. For Karen, non-essential items include loafers but not stilettos, and children’s animals of both the stuffed and living variety: “Oh my, this is going to be a tough life lesson, right?” For his part, Captain Clark is working hard under Billie’s tutelage to learn to fly the ship since his fingerprints are the only ones paired with the emergency protocol when it comes time to dock the Avenue 5. It’s not going great! “Was that a good explosion?” Captain Clark asks when the flight simulator blows up on all of the screens surrounding him?” “Well… we were in it,” Billie replies, and at this point, that could be spun as a positive or a negative. Because no one living aboard the Avenue 5 is doing very well right now, including Herman Judd, whose self-described moods exclusively include “elation and genius.” But when Judd hears from Matt that Captain Clark has a major sedatives problem, and subsequently hears from Captain Clark that the sedatives he was collecting were in fact intended to sedate Judd during the recent beeping incident, Judd fires Captain Clark. Which Captain Clark quickly matches by quitting, announcing: “I’m done tugging my forelock—in fact, you can fucking have my forelock!” If, like me, you weren’t familiar with the term “forelock,” it’s the front bit of one’s hair. And if, like me, you have a passing familiarity with Hugh Laurie’s hairline, but have grown accustomed to Captain Clark’s picture perfect coif, then prepare for perhaps the biggest twist of Avenue 5’s extremely twisty plot thus far… “You’re British and bald,” Iris screams as Captain Clark tugs his wig off revealing a completely average head of middle-aged hair. “Balding,” Captain Clark clarifies as the nearby passengers begin breaking into hysterics with the realization that not only is their captain balding, he’s also their former captain now. “Re-hair yourself, please,” Judd begs. “I’ll re-captain you!” But Captain Clark doesn’t want to be re-captained. He heads back out into the Avenue 5 as a civilian, and Spike is named the interim captain of the ship. That’s when things really start going downhill. Not because Spike is a bad captain, but because he actually has a working knowledge of how space ships should function, and a bridge deck full of models who say the same three lines over and over isn’t a part of that. And while Spike is catching onto something shady on the bridge, the Avenue 5 passengers have begun to connect a few (less credible) dots of their own. One particularly vocal passenger works in VFX — “that stands for visual effects,” she’ll be quick to tell you — back on Earth, and she starts spreading the word that some things aboard the Avenue 5 seem reminiscent of a movie set. Like the captain suddenly being out of costume and speaking in a different accent…and the décor falling off the walls like cheap props…and the bridge crew openly admitting to being actors. And while all of that is certainly suspicious, and could make one think that perhaps all of this chaos has actually just been some sort of simulation for a reality show, and maybe they’ve actually remained on earth this whole time… None of it should be enough to convince a grown adult that they should go through the airlock and test that theory. But as Captain Clark says to the mob mounting near the airlock yelling that they’re clearly on a reality show: “Wow, you guys are stupid, even for rich people.” “Hey, don’t talk to rich people like that!” Judd defends. Because even he — the owner of this ship — is getting a little confused by the argument that none of this is real, and maybe if they just go through the airlock, they’ll be whisked away to a green room and back to their families. The couple that left their son in a coma to come on a luxury vacation are particularly convinced by this argument, so when Matt announces the air lock code in an attempt at a sort of reverse psychology (and his armchair psychologist rap sheet had been flawless to this point!), the father of the coma-son rushes into the airlock. The outer doors open to release him either to outer space or a production set, and everyone looks on hopefully… As his eyeballs explode out of their sockets, his body freezes, and he floats out into the great unknown. Which VFX lady naturally convinces everyone could have just been done with special effects. So then the man’s wife and Mr. Harrison decide to take their stab at getting back to earth, rushing the airlock themselves. And when the doors open… Their eyes explode out of their sockets, and their bodies freeze, and they float out into space. In the chaos of it all, Sarah/Sara charges the airlock along with three other passengers, and their eyeballs explode, their bodies freeze, et cetera, et cetera. “Well you laughing gnome, you still think it’s visual fucking effects?” Captain Clark asks. “Okay, well the ‘f’ doesn’t stand for ‘f—ing,’ but I will admit that I’m on the fence,” VFX lady replies after watching 14 individual eyeballs explode. During all of this, Rav is making her way toward the Avenue 5 aboard the supplies rocket that only has one available seat for the return to earth, and since Judd intends on taking it, Rav has had to spend the ride convincing herself that maybe life aboard a luxury space ship with just a slight prison vibe is still overall better than the media frenzy she’s been dealing with at Mission Control. As juuust as she’s about made it to that mental conclusion…seven eyeball-less bodies hit the windshield of the supplies rocket. A FEW SPACE NUGGETS Iris and Billie were particularly savage this episode. “Back off buddy, or you will feel my wrath,” Iris tells Mr. Harrison when he threatens Mr. Judd. “I am fire — literally fire — and I will burn the jelly in your fat eyes and use your tongue to wipe surfaces with!” “These people are so dumb. I am just hanging out with pigs and dolphins when we get back.” –Billie, not wrong, as usual While collecting non-essential items to eject from the ship, Karen tells people to ask themselves if they would exchange their trinkets for a human life: “Because basically everything we own right now — blood diamonds.” While Matt goes full Kondo for all items, including teddy bears: “Here’s what we’re gonna do little man, we’re gonna thank him for his service — and then send him to his death.” The Future Is Now: “You guys know bloody marys? It’s an old drink named after this woman who liked to set Protestants on fire.” “I’m just gonna listen to this true crime podcast about that Greta Gerwig thing … everyone has a theory on it.” Related content: HBO’s amusing Avenue 5 sends Hugh Laurie into orbit: Review Avenue 5 recap: Prepare for penury", "comments": [], "heur": 72.0, "source_site": "ew.com", "priority": 72, "author": "", "url": "", "ts": 1770989611, "type": "item", "tags": [], "metrics": {}}], "live_prompts": {}, "_log_last": {"tts_heartbeat": 1770989702, "producer_heartbeat": 1770989695, "router_heartbeat": 1770989699, "host_wait": 1770068705, "rebalancer_need_prune": 1770989486}, "docs": {"strategy": {"text": "", "hash": "da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709", "ts": 1769932862, "path": "./strategy_reference.txt", "max_chars": 5000}, "playbook": {"text": "", "hash": "da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709", "ts": 1769932862, "path": "./coach_playbook.txt", "max_chars": 7000}}, "_doc_announce_last": {"strategy": 1769932862}, "_markets_tape": [], "_video_timeline_items": [], "_video_timeline_tape": [], "_video_timeline_state": {"running": false, "paused": false, "started_ts": 0, "pause_started_ts": 0, "pause_accum_sec": 0.0, "fired_ids": {}, "active_item": null, "active_until_ts": 0, "last_error": ""}, "_boot_open_played": true, "_mem_last_save_ts": 1770989706, "ui_last_seg": {"id": "b7a04ff071b301d72506f690f76feb6e44a52896", "post_id": "3b2502b0651a3b099b9fe943c7cc0a9309cbe5f5", "source": "reddit", "event_type": "post", "title": "The 800th 'The Simpsons' episode is set in Philadelphia.
